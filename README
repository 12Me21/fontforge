INSTALLATION NOTES:
 This distribution may be in two formats, either it contains dynamic libraries
 or it does not.

INSTALLATION WITH DYNAMIC LIBRARIES
 contains two executables:
 	pfaedit -- a font editor
	sfddiff -- a program for comparing fonts
 man pages for the above
	pfaedit.1
	sfddiff.1
 two libraries
	libgdraw.so
	libgunicode.so
 and some user interface files
	pfaedit.{en,fr,de,ru,ja}.ui
 and a shell script
	doinstall
 which should put everything into a reasonable place (you probably need to be
 root to run it).

 If you want to edit CID-keyed fonts (for CJK fonts) you may want to pull down
 the cidmap package from http://pfaedit.sf.net/cidmaps.tgz and move the
 contents to /usr/share/pfaedit also.

INSTALLATION WITHOUT DYNAMIC LIBRARIES
 Otherwise the package will contain:
	A README file or two
	pfaedit      -- the executable
	pfaedit.1    --	the man page.
	pfaedit-*.ui --	various user interface string files for different
			languages
    You should:
    	$ su
	# mkdir -p /usr/local/bin /usr/local/man/man1 /usr/local/share/pfaedit
	# mv pfaedit /usr/local/bin
	# mv *.1 /usr/local/man/man1
	# mv *.ui /usr/local/share/pfaedit

    You may need to add /usr/local/bin to your PATH environment variable (and
    /usr/local/man to your MANPATH environment variable). If you use bash edit
    ~/.bashrc and add
    	PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/bin
	MANPATH=${MANPATH:-}:/usr/local/man ; export MANPATH
    Or if you use csh, tcsh, etc. edit your ~/.cshrc and add:
    	setenv PATH ${PATH}:/usr/local/bin
	if ( $?MANPATH == "0" ) then
	    setenv MANPATH /usr/local/man
	else
	    setenv MANPATH ${MANPATH}:/usr/local/man
	endif

BUILDING
    Just download the file pfaedit_full-*.tgz which you will find on
	http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net/index.html#source
    Move it somewhere appropriate (/usr/local/src perhaps?) and type:
	$ gunzip pfaedit_full-*.tgz ; tar xf pfaedit_full-*.tar
	$ cd pfaedit
	$ configure
	$ make
	$ su
	# make install
    On those machines where I can't figure out how to build dynamic
    libraries you should substitute "configure.static" for configure.

    I can't get libtool to work on solaris.

More complex installations
    "make install" will also install a few other things which are not part of
    the standard package, but which are useful for some people.
    CIDMAPS:
	If you are going to be editing CID keyed fonts you should also down-
	load my cidmap files from
		http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net/cidmaps.tgz
	put that file in the same place as you put pfaedit_full*.tgz, then
	    $ mkdir -p pfaedit/cidmaps
	    $ mv cidmaps.tgz pfaedit/cidmaps
	    $ cd pfaedit/cidmaps
	    $ gunzip *.tgz ; tar xf *.tar
	    $ cd ../..
	And then proceed to do the normal install.
    DOCUMENTATION:
	You can choose to install PfaEdit's documentation on your system, then
	pressing the [Help] or [F1] key within PfaEdit will go to the local
	docs rather than those on the web.
	Download the doc bundle from
	    http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net/index.html#docs
	Then (assuming you have not changed the install prefix)
	    # mkdir -p /usr/local/share/doc/pfaedit
	    # mv pfaedit_htdocs-*.tgz /usr/local/share/doc/pfaedit
	    # cd /usr/local/share/doc/pfaedit
	    # gunzip *.tgz; tar xf *.tar

BUILDING for OpenVMS
    Jouk Jansen has provided me with OpenVMS makefile scripts. There should
    be mms files in all the appropriate directories.

BUILDING without X11
    PfaEdit can be built without X11. You will probably only want to do this
    if your system lacks X (in which case configure should figure that out and
    do it automagically). But if, for some strange reason you wish to build a
    non-X version on a machine with X type:
	$ configure --without-x

KNOWN BUILD PROBLEMS
    * If the configure script doesn't work for you try using
	$ make -f makefile.orig
	* The gdraw package expects to find libjpeg, libtiff, libpng and
	  libungif on your system. If any of these is not present then define
	  -D_NO_LIBUNGIF etc. in the makefile.
	* the final link requests -ldl. On some systems (netbsd for instance)
	  libdl is part of libc and can't be found. Just remove it from the
	  LIBS list in the pfaedit/makefile and rebuild.

BITMAP FONTS
 The program sort of assumes you've got some unicode fonts lying around.
 The program will choose fonts as best it can depending on what you have
 installed on your machine.
   Sources of unicode fonts:
	http://czyborra.com/unifont/
	http://clr.nmsu.edu/~mleisher/cu.html
	http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/freefont
        http://bibliofile.mc.duke.edu/gww/fonts/{Monospace,Caliban}
	
RUNNING
$ pfaedit -new
 Creates a new font
$ pfaedit -nosplash
 (No splash screen in case you have a very slow X connection)
$ pfaedit font.pfa font2.pfb font3.ttf font4.otf font4.sfd
 Opens those fonts (sfd files are pfaedit's own spline font database files)
$ pfaedit
 Brings up a file picker dlg.
