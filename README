INSTALLATION NOTES:
 Currently this distribution contains two executables:
 	pfaedit -- a font editor
	sfddiff -- a program for comparing fonts
 man pages for the above
	pfaedit.1
	sfddiff.1
 two libraries
	libgdraw.so
	libgunicode.so
 and some user interface files
	pfaedit.{en,fr,de,ru,ja}.ui
 and a shell script
	doinstall
 which should put everything into a reasonable place (you probably need to be
 root to run it).

 If you want to edit CID-keyed fonts (for CJK fonts) you may want to pull down
 the cidmap package from http://pfaedit.sf.net/cidmaps.tgz and move the
 contents to /usr/share/pfaedit also.

BITMAP FONTS
 The program sort of assumes you've got some unicode fonts lying around.
 The program will choose fonts as best it can depending on what you have
 installed on your machine.
   Sources of unicode fonts:
	http://clr.nmsu.edu/~mleisher/cu.html
        http://bibliofile.mc.duke.edu/gww/fonts/{Monospace,Caliban}
