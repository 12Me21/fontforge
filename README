I appologize for the roughness of this process, this is all new stuff and it's
not completely finished.

BUILDING
    This distribution comes in three parts which should merge nicely
    If you just are interested in pfaedit then
	cd to this directory
	$ setenv CFLAGS -g
	$ configure
	$ make

    The first part is a unicode data library, to build it
	cd to this directory
	$ configure
	$ make libgunicode
    The second part is a unicode widget package, to build it
	cd to this directory
	$ configure
	$ make gdraw
    The third part is pfaedit.
	cd to this directory
	$ configure
	$ make pfaedit

BUILDING for OpenVMS
    Jouk Jansen has provided me with OpenVMS makefile scripts. There should
    be mms files in all the appropriate directories.

NOTE:
    During the beta process I have the program linked with static versions of
    libgdraw and libgunicode. I intend to link with the dynamic ones once
    debugging is not an issue. Similarly I suggest that you set CFLAGS to
    -g before running configure (otherwise it sets -O2 as well), I don't trust
    debug information after the optimizer has run.

KNOWN BUILD PROBLEMS
    * If the configure script doesn't work for you try using
	$ make -f makefile.orig
	* The gdraw package expects to find libjpeg, libtiff, libpng and
	  libungif on your system. If any of these is not present then define
	  -D_NO_LIBUNGIF etc. in the makefile.
	* the final link requests -ldl. On some systems (netbsd for instance)
	  libdl is part of libc and can't be found. Just remove it from the
	  LIBS list in the pfaedit/makefile and rebuild.

INSTALLING
    Er, I'm not really sure of the best way to do this. If you su root (or
    	anyone else with write access to /usr/local) and type
	$ make install
	then it will copy the various bits to the appropriate places in
	/usr/local.
	On my system you still will need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include
	/usr/local/lib (during beta this comment is irrelevant)

At some point I'm going to provide docs for gdraw and make it useful. For now
It's just included as something pfaedit needs.
