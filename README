INSTALLATION NOTES:
 Currently this distribution just contains an executable:
 	pfaedit
 and some user interface files
	pfaedit.{en,fr,de,ru}.ui
 The user interface files should be placed in /usr/share/pfaedit (you may
 need to create the directory).

 If you want to edit CID-keyed fonts (for CJK fonts) you may want to pull down
 the cidmap package from http://pfaedit.sf.net/cidmaps.tgz and move the
 contents to /usr/share/pfaedit also.

BITMAP FONTS
 The program sort of assumes you've got some unicode fonts lying around. I'm
 not exactly sure what is needed, the program sort of picks and chooses
 depending on what's available. I noticed it used my unicode fonts
 (you can grab them from http://bibliofile.mc.duke.edu/gww/fonts/{Monospace,Cal),
 and something which I think is now part of the standard X distribution. It
 might also need to grab the clearlyu fonts which are freeware:
