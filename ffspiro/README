This is a shared library designed to give FontForge access to Raph Levien's
spiro splines. As such you MUST have downloaded the spiro sources before
configuring this.

Spiro may be obtained from
    http://www.levien.com/spiro/
Download the source. Unpack it. Then come back to this directory and type:
    ./configure --with-spiro-srcdir=<wherever you put it>
(Note that you do not need to build ppedit nor anything else in the spiro
package to build libffspiro)

Currently I extract very little from spiro, just the bare minimum to convert
a series of (marked) points to a set of cubic bezier curves which ff can use.

This is not part of the main FontForge build because spiro is released with a
different license.
