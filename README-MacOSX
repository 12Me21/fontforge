BEFORE INSTALLATION
 Before you install pfaedit under Mac OS/X you should first install the X window
 system. I did this as a two step process, first installing the XFree86 Darwin
 distribution,
	ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/4.1.0/binaries/Darwin-ppc/
 (with docs at
	http://www.xfree86.org/4.1.0/Darwin.html	and
	http://www.xfree86.org/4.1.0/Install.html	)
 and then installing the XonX distribution on top of it
	http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/xonx/XDarwin1.0a2.tgz

 It is possible to use pfaedit without X, but in this case there is no user
 interface and you are limited to running scripts.

INSTALLATION NOTES:
    Download the appropriate binary from
    	http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net/Problems-MacOSX.html#binary
    If it is a .tgz file then it should contain
	A README file or two
	pfaedit      -- the executable
	pfaedit.1    --	the man page.
	pfaedit-*.ui --	various user interface string files for different
			languages
    You should:
	$ gunzip pfaedit_MacOSX*.tgz; tar xf pfaedit_MacOSX*.tar
    	$ su
	# mkdir -p /usr/local/bin /usr/local/man/man1 /usr/local/share/pfaedit
	# mv pfaedit /usr/local/bin
	# mv pfaedit.1 /usr/local/man/man1
	# mv *.ui /usr/local/share/pfaedit
    You may need to add /usr/local/bin to your PATH environment variable (and
    /usr/local/man to your MANPATH environment variable)
    If your shell is tcsh (or csh), edit ~/.cshrc and add:
    	setenv PATH ${PATH}:/usr/local/bin
	if ( "$MANPATH" == "" ) then
	    setenv MANPATH /usr/local/man
	else
	    setenv MANPATH ${MANPATH}:/usr/local/man
	endif
    If your shell is bash then edit your ~/.bashrc and add
    	PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/bin
	MANPATH=${MANPATH:-}:/usr/local/man ; export MANPATH

BUILDING
    Just download the file pfaedit_full-*.tgz which you will find on
	http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net/index.html#source
    Move it somewhere appropriate (/usr/local/src perhaps?) and type:
	$ gunzip pfaedit_full-*.tgz ; tar xf pfaedit_full-*.tar
	$ cd pfaedit
	$ configure.static
	$ make
	$ su
	# make install

More complex installations
    "make install" will also install a few other things which are not part of
    the standard package, but which are useful for some people.
    CIDMAPS:
	If you are going to be editing CID keyed fonts you should also down-
	load my cidmap files from
		http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net/cidmaps.tgz
	put that file in the same place as you put pfaedit_full*.tgz, then
	    $ mkdir -p pfaedit/cidmaps
	    $ mv cidmaps.tgz pfaedit/cidmaps
	    $ cd pfaedit/cidmaps
	    $ gunzip *.tgz ; tar xf *.tar
	    $ cd ../..
	And then proceed to do the normal install.
	Or install them manually:
	    # mkdir -p /usr/local/share/pfaedit
	    # mv pfaedit/cidmaps/* /usr/local/share/pfaedit
    DOCUMENTATION:
	(On the mac this probably won't work since I can't figure out how to
	run internet explorer, the most likely browser)
	You can choose to install PfaEdit's documentation on your system, then
	pressing the [Help] or [F1] key within PfaEdit will go to the local
	docs rather than those on the web.
	Download the doc bundle from
	    http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net/index.html#docs
	Then (assuming you have not changed the install prefix)
	    # mkdir -p /usr/local/share/doc/pfaedit
	    # mv pfaedit_htdocs-*.tgz /usr/local/share/doc/pfaedit
	    # cd /usr/local/share/doc/pfaedit
	    # gunzip *.tgz; tar xf *.tar

BUILDING without X11
    PfaEdit can be built without X11. You will probably only want to do this
    if your system lacks X (in which case configure should figure that out and
    do it automagically). But if, for some strange reason you wish to build a
    non-X version on a machine with X type:
	$ configure --without-x
    during the build process instead of "$ configure"

RUNNING
 Before running PfaEdit you must start XDarwin. It lives in the Applications
 folder, and you start it by double clicking on it.
 You can start pfaedit either from one of the xterms it creates, or from a
 Terminal window. If you start from a Terminal window you must first type:
$ setenv DISPLAY :0

$ pfaedit -new
 Creates a new font
$ pfaedit -nosplash
 (No splash screen in case you have a very slow X connection)
$ pfaedit font.pfa font2.pfb font3.ttf font4.otf font4.sfd
 Opens those fonts (sfd files are pfaedit's own spline font database files)
$ pfaedit
 Brings up a file picker dlg.
$ pfaedit -script script-file [script arguments]
 Starts pfaedit up without bringing up any windows. It will run the script-file
 (passing it any other arguments given on the command line) and then exit.

Either the Command (Apple, Cloverleaf) key or the Control key may be used for
invoking menu items (that is both ^Q and Cmd-Q will cause PfaEdit to quit).

CAVEATS
 1) PfaEdit does not conform to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, and never
    will.
 2) The default window manager (twm) does not work well with PfaEdit when
    run in Rootless mode.
    PfaEdit allows the window manager to position its windows for it, and
    twm does this by allowing the user to click anywhere on the screen to
    mark the upper left corner of the window. Unfortunately if you click on
    top of an Aqua window (ie. anything that isn't X window) Aqua will put
    X into the background and the click will be lost to X.

    You can only open a window if you position it so that it's upper left
    corner is in one of X's already existing windows.

FONTS UNDER Mac OS/X
 Macintosh fonts live in /Library/Fonts, /System/Library/Fonts or
 ~/Library/Fonts. On Mac OS/X PfaEdit can edit .dfont and resource fork
 fonts. On other systems PfaEdit can only edit Mac .dfonts (the concept
 of a resource fork is Mac specific).

 (X11 fonts on the mac are completely seperate from the mac fonts.
 they reside somewhere in the X tree).

FONTS UNDER Mac OS/9
 Note Bene: As far as I know PfaEdit has not been ported to Mac OS/9 (or 8 or 7)

 Fonts live in :System Folder:Fonts: They are stored in resource forks, which
 means that if you want to work with them you must first wrap them up with
 either macbinary or binhex (Fetch may be used to do either conversion as you
 transfer the font to a different system to edit it).
