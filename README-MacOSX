BEFORE INSTALLATION
 Before you install pfaedit under Mac OS/X you must first install the X window
 system. I did this as a two step process, first installing the XFree86 Darwin
 distribution,
	ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/4.1.0/binaries/Darwin-ppc/
 (with docs at
	http://www.xfree86.org/4.1.0/Darwin.html	and
	http://www.xfree86.org/4.1.0/Install.html	)
 and then installing the XonX distribution on top of it
	http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/xonx/XDarwin1.0a2.tgz

INSTALLATION NOTES:
 Currently this distribution just contains an executable:
 	pfaedit
 and some user interface files
	pfaedit.{en,fr,de,ru}.ui
 The user interface files should be placed in /usr/share/pfaedit (you may
 need to create the directory).

 If you want to edit CID-keyed fonts (for CJK fonts) you may want to pull down
 the cidmap package from http://pfaedit.sf.net/cidmaps.tgz and move the
 contents to /usr/share/pfaedit also.

BITMAP FONTS (for PfaEdit's use, not to edit)
 The program sort of assumes you've got some unicode fonts lying around. I'm
 not exactly sure what is needed, the program sort of picks and chooses
 depending on what's available. I noticed it used my unicode fonts
 (you can grab them from http://bibliofile.mc.duke.edu/gww/fonts/{Monospace,Cal),
 and something which I think is now part of the standard X distribution. It
 might also need to grab the clearlyu fonts which are freeware:

RUNNING
 Before running PfaEdit you must start XDarwin. It lives in the Applications
 folder, and you start it by double clicking on it.
 You can start pfaedit either from one of the xterms it creates, or from a
 Terminal window. If you start from a Terminal window you must first type:
$ setenv DISPLAY :0

$ pfaedit -new
 Creates a new font
$ pfaedit -nosplash
 (No splash screen in case you have a very slow X connection)
$ pfaedit font.pfa font2.pfb font3.ttf font4.otf font4.sfd
 Opens those fonts (sfd files are pfaedit's own spline font database files)
$ pfaedit
 Brings up a file picker dlg.

Either the Command (Apple, Cloverleaf) key or the Control key may be used for
invoking menu items (that is both ^Q and Cmd-Q will cause PfaEdit to quit).

CAVEATS
 1) PfaEdit does not conform to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, and never
    will.
 2) PfaEdit does not know how to read a font out of a resource fork.
    You cannot create an NFNT with 2byte encodings (CJK), use the "sbit"
    bitmap format instead (which is only available if No Outline Font is
    generated. (I can't test this well, it works in my simple tests)
 3) The default window manager (twm) does not work well with PfaEdit when
    run in Rootless mode.
    PfaEdit allows the window manager to position its windows for it, and
    twm does this by allowing the user to click anywhere on the screen to
    mark the upper left corner of the window. Unfortunately if you click on
    top of an Aqua window (ie. anything that isn't X window) Aqua will put
    X into the background and the click will be lost to X.

    You can only open a window if you position it so that it's upper left
    corner is in one of X's already existing windows.

DOCUMENTATION

FONTS UNDER Mac OS/X
 Fonts live in /Library/Fonts, /System/Library/Fonts or ~/Library/Fonts.
 PfaEdit can read .dfont fonts, PfaEdit cannot edit resource fork fonts
 directly.

 If you see a font file where ls tells you the size is zero then it will
 probably be a font in a resource fork. If you want to edit it, first package
 it up in macbinary (or binhex) format, PfaEdit can read it out of the package.

FONTS UNDER Mac OS/9
 Note Bene: As far as I know PfaEdit has not been ported to Mac OS/9 (or 8 or 7)

 Fonts live in :System Folder:Fonts: They are stored in resource forks, which
 means that if you want to work with them you must first wrap them up with
 either macbinary or binhex (Fetch may be used to do either conversion as you
 transfer the font to a different system to edit it).
