BEFORE INSTALLATION
 Before you install pfaedit under Mac OS/X you should first install the X
 window system. This is available at:
	http://www.osxgnu.org/

 It is possible to use pfaedit without X, but in this case there is no user
 interface and you are limited to running scripts. (see below for details)

INSTALLATION NOTES:
    Download the appropriate binary from
        http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net/MacOSX.html#binary
    There should be a mac package there which will do the installation for you.
    You may need to add /usr/local/bin to your PATH environment variable (and
    /usr/local/share/man to your MANPATH environment variable)
    If your shell is tcsh (or csh), edit ~/.cshrc and add:
        setenv PATH ${PATH}:/usr/local/bin
        if ( "$MANPATH" == "" ) then
            setenv MANPATH /usr/local/man
        else
            setenv MANPATH ${MANPATH}:/usr/local/share/man
        endif
    If your shell is bash then edit your ~/.bashrc and add
        PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/bin   
        MANPATH=${MANPATH:-}:/usr/local/share/man ; export MANPATH

BUILDING
    Just download the file pfaedit_full-*.tgz which you will find on
        http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net/index.html#source
    Move it somewhere appropriate (/usr/local/src perhaps?) and type:
        $ gunzip pfaedit_full-*.tgz ; tar xf pfaedit_full-*.tar
        $ cd pfaedit
        $ configure
        $ make
        $ sudo -s
        # make install

More complex installations
    "make install" will also install a few other things which are not part of
    the standard package, but which are useful for some people.
    CIDMAPS:
        If you are going to be editing CID keyed fonts you should also down-
        load my cidmap files from
                http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net/cidmaps.tgz
        put that file in the same place as you put pfaedit_full*.tgz, then
            $ mkdir -p pfaedit/cidmaps
            $ mv cidmaps.tgz pfaedit/cidmaps
            $ cd pfaedit/cidmaps
            $ gunzip *.tgz ; tar xf *.tar
            $ cd ../..
        And then proceed to do the normal install.
        Or install them manually:
            # mkdir -p /usr/local/share/pfaedit
            # mv pfaedit/cidmaps/* /usr/local/share/pfaedit
    DOCUMENTATION:
        You can choose to install PfaEdit's documentation on your system, then
        pressing the [Help] or [F1] key within PfaEdit will go to the local
        docs rather than those on the web.
        Download the doc bundle from
            http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net/index.html#docs
        Then (assuming you have not changed the install prefix)
            # mkdir -p /usr/local/share/doc/pfaedit
            # mv pfaedit_htdocs-*.tgz /usr/local/share/doc/pfaedit
            # cd /usr/local/share/doc/pfaedit
            # gunzip *.tgz; tar xf *.tar

BUILDING without X11
    PfaEdit can be built without X11. You will probably only want to do this
    if your system lacks X (in which case configure should figure that out and
    do it automagically). But if, for some strange reason you wish to build a
    non-X version on a machine with X type:
        $ configure --without-x
    during the build process instead of "$ configure"      

RUNNING
 Before running PfaEdit you must start XDarwin. It lives in the Applications
 folder, and you start it by double clicking on it.
 You can start pfaedit either from one of the xterms it creates, or from a 
 Terminal window. If you start from a Terminal window you must first type:
$ setenv DISPLAY :0

$ pfaedit -new
 Creates a new font
$ pfaedit -nosplash
 (No splash screen in case you have a very slow X connection)
$ pfaedit font.pfa font2.pfb font3.ttf font4.otf font4.sfd
 Opens those fonts (sfd files are pfaedit's own spline font database files)
$ pfaedit
 Brings up a file picker dlg.
$ pfaedit -script script-file [script arguments]
 Starts pfaedit up without bringing up any windows. It will run the script-file
 (passing it any other arguments given on the command line) and then exit.

Either the Command (Apple, Cloverleaf) key or the Control key may be used for
invoking menu items (that is both ^Q and Cmd-Q will cause PfaEdit to quit).

CAVEATS
 1) PfaEdit does not conform to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, and never
    will.
 2) The default window manager (twm) does not work well when 
    run in Rootless mode.
    PfaEdit allows the window manager to position its windows for it, and
    twm does this by allowing the user to click anywhere on the screen to
    mark the upper left corner of the window. Unfortunately if you click on
    top of an Aqua window (ie. anything that isn't X window) Aqua will put
    X into the background and the click will be lost to X.   

    So in rootless mode you can only open a window if you position it so
   that it's upper left  corner is in one of X's already existing windows.

FONTS UNDER Mac OS/X
 Macintosh fonts live in /Library/Fonts, /System/Library/Fonts or
 ~/Library/Fonts. On Mac OS/X PfaEdit can edit .dfont and resource fork      
 fonts. On other systems PfaEdit can only edit Mac .dfonts (the concept
 of a resource fork is Mac specific).

 (X11 fonts on the mac are completely seperate from the mac fonts.       
 they reside somewhere in the X tree).

FONTS UNDER Mac OS/9
 Note Bene: As far as I know PfaEdit has not been ported to Mac OS/9 (or 8 or 7)

 Fonts live in :System Folder:Fonts: They are stored in resource forks, which
 means that if you want to work with them you must first wrap them up with 
 either macbinary or binhex (Fetch may be used to do either conversion as you
 transfer the font to a different system to edit it).
