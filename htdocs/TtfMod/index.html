<P>
TtfMod is not a font creation program, look at
<A HREF="../overview.html">PfaEdit</A> for that. It is designed as a companion
program to PfaEdit, to take an existing TrueType (OpenType, TrueType Collection)
file and allow you to edit some of the tables. This is primarily to provide
access to certain features of TrueType that would be awkward to fold into
PfaEdit's UI, specifically TrueType instructing (hinting). (And perhaps it
will help me figure out why PfaEdit's TrueType instructing is so bad).

<P>
This window shows you all the tables in the truetype file. It also shows
you where those tables start and how big they are (that's probably useless
information in almost all cases). Double clicking on a table will bring up
a table editor to allow you to modify that particular table. Double clicking
with the control key down will bring up a bare hex editor. Not all tables
are editable (yet), and some tables are tightly connected so you can't edit
one without editing the other (for example the loca and glyp tables are bound
together).
<P>
If you move the cursor onto one of the tables and leave it there, a popup
will appear giving a better explanation of the table than the often cryptic
four character name.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><SMALL>NOTE: </SMALL></STRONG></FONT> TTF tables
are often intricately interconnected. Be careful about changing things that
affect other tables. ttfmod will not fix up the others. For example: don't
change the Glyph Count field in the 'maxp' table or you will confuse almost
every other table.
<P>
No access will be provided to the CFF table of an opentype font. This is
essentially postscript data and is better viewed from PfaEdit.
<P>
In a ttc file (A TrueType collection file) there may be more than one font.

I shall not attempt to explain what all the tables do, I refer you to the
True/Open Type docs for that:
