  <DT>
    <A NAME="Font">Font</A> Info
  <DD>
    In all views this brings up the <A HREF="fontinfo.html">Font Info dialog</A>.
  <DT>
    Get/Char <A NAME="Info">Info</A>
  <DD>
    In the outline view this brings up <A HREF="getinfo.html">one of four different
    dialogs</A> (Point Info, Image Info, Reference Info or Character Info) depending
    on what is selected.<BR>
    In the font and bitmap view this only brings up the
    <A HREF="getinfo.html#Character">Character Info dialog</A>.
  <DT>
    Find <A NAME="Problems">Problems</A>...
  <DD>
    This command is only present in the font view and the outline character view
    and will search for several common problems. In the character view it will
    select anything that needs to be fixed, in the font view it will check all
    selected characters and if any have problems will open them and select the
    problems. It will post a message telling you of each problem found. It brings
    up the <A HREF="problems.html">Find Problem</A> dialog to let you choose
    what problems to look for.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Bitmaps">Bitmaps</A> Available...
  <DD>
    This brings up a list of pixel sizes for bitmap fonts.<BR>
    <IMG SRC="bitmapsavail.png" WIDTH="263" HEIGHT="298"><BR>
    If you have bitmap fonts this will show their pixel sizes. If you remove
    a size that is in the list then that font will be deleted from the sfd file.
    If you add a size then that size font will be created and stored in the sfd
    file. Note that on X the conversion between pixel size and point size is
    dependent on the screen resolution. Two common resolutions are used on X:
    75dpi and 100dpi. This dialog provides the conversion between pixel size
    and point sizes at these resolutions.
    <P>
    Normally the new characters are created by rasterizing the outline font,
    but if you are only editing bitmaps (with no outline font) then the new
    characters will be created by scaling the font displayed in the font view.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Regenerate">Regenerate</A> Bitmaps...
  <DD>
    If you have changed the outline that a bitmap is based one then you should
    (at some point) look into changing the bitmap too. This command allows you
    to regenerate a subset of the characters in a given bitmap font. In the font
    view you can regenerate all selected characters, while in the bitmap and
    outline views you can regenerate the current character. You can pick what
    pixel sizes should be regenerated too (unlike the above command, removing
    a bitmap size from the regenerate list will not delete it).
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Transform">Transform</A>...
  <DD>
    <A HREF="transform.html">In the Font and Outline Views this brings up a
    dialog</A>, but in the bitmap view there is a submenu with a selection of
    choices that are meaningful in a bitmap.
    <DL>
      <DT>
	<A NAME="Flip">Flip</A> Horizontally
      <DD>
	Flips the bitmap horizontally.
      <DT>
	<A NAME="FlipV">Flip</A> Vertically
      <DD>
	Flips the bitmap vertically.
      <DT>
	<A NAME="Rotate">Rotate</A> 90&#176; CW
      <DD>
	Rotates the bitmap 90&#176; clockwise.
      <DT>
	<A NAME="Rotate90CCW">Rotate</A> 90&#176; CCW
      <DD>
	Rotates the bitmap 90&#176; counter-clockwise.
      <DT>
	<A NAME="Rotate180">Rotate</A> 180&#176;
      <DD>
	Rotates the bitmap 180&#176;
      <DT>
	<A NAME="Skew">Skew</A>
      <DD>
	Allows you to specify a ratio by which to skew the bitmap 1:3 means for every
	3 pixel rise in y, skew the bitmap one pixel horizontally.
    </DL>
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Expand">Expand</A> Stroke...
  <DD>
    Only in the font and outline views. In the font view it applies to all foreground
    splines in all selected characters. In the outline view it applies to all
    paths that have at least one point selected (or if no points are selected
    then it applies to all paths).<BR>
    <IMG SRC="twolines.png" WIDTH="247" HEIGHT="247">
    <IMG SRC="expandedlines.png" WIDTH="247" HEIGHT="247"><BR>
    Above is a simple example of what expand stroke can do. It takes the two
    open paths above left and turns them into the two closed paths right.<BR>
    <IMG SRC="expandstroke.png" WIDTH="317" HEIGHT="295"><BR>
    The Expand Stroke dialog gives you control over various aspects of the expansion
    process. You can chose a stroke width, how the ends of an open path should
    be drawn, and how the path should look when two splines (or lines) join which
    do not have the same slope (ie. at a corner point). Or you may choose to
    have the path be that which would be traced by a calligraphic pen.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Remove">Remove</A> Overlap
  <DD>
    Only in the font and outline views. If two closed paths intersect then there
    will be overlap. This will get rid of it, leaving one closed path behind.
    (if the path directions are wonky, strange things result).<BR>
    <IMG SRC="expandedlines.png" WIDTH="247" HEIGHT="247">
    <IMG SRC="overlappedlines.png" WIDTH="247" HEIGHT="247">
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Simplify">Simplify</A>
  <DD>
    Only in the font and outline views. If you have lots of points on a path,
    some of which do not materially add to the path's shape, then this command
    will remove the extraneous points.
  <DT>
    Cleanup Char
  <DD>
    This is a variant on the simplify command, obtainable if you hold down the
    shift key when invoking the menu. In this case if there is a spline which
    actually traces out a line but none the less has control points, then this
    command will remove the control points.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Round">Round</A> to Int
  <DD>
    Only in the font and outline views. PfaEdit stores point locations as real
    numbers (ie. it retains fractional values). TrueType and PostScript Type1
    only support integral values (Well with vast effort Type1 fonts can be made
    to support real numbers but PfaEdit doesn't), so when generating the font
    points are rounded to integral values. Open Type allows real numbers easily.
    But they make the font file bigger. This command will round all selected
    locations to the closest integer.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="MetaFont">MetaFont</A>...
  <DD>
    This <A HREF="metafont.html">dialog</A> is only present in the font and outline
    character views. It allows you to make fonts bolder or condensed. It doesn't
    work very well.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="AutoTrace">AutoTrace</A>
  <DD>
    This command is only available if you have downloaded Martin Weber's
    <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/autotrace/">autotrace program</A>.
    If you have a background image in a character then autotrace will automagically
    trace the outlines of that image.<BR>
    I may not be loading the results of autotrace properly in all cases (I do
    in my test cases, of course). AutoTrace traces out both foreground and background
    regions, so I may sometimes leave behind a lump which represents a background
    area. Just delete it if it happens (and send me the image so I can fix things
    up).
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Clockwise">Clockwise</A>
  <DD>
    Only in the outline view. If all selected paths have a clockwise direction
    then this will be checked. Selecting it will make all paths be clockwise.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Counter">Counter</A>-Clockwise
  <DD>
    Only in the outline view. If all selected paths have a counter-clockwise
    direction then this will be checked. Selecting it will make all paths be
    counter-clockwise.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Correct">Correct</A> Direction
  <DD>
    Only in the outline view. Sets the direction of outermost paths to be clockwise.
    The next path crossed will be made counter-clockwise, the next clockwise,
    etc.<BR>
    This command may produce unexpected results if two splines cross.
  <DT>
    Build <A NAME="Accented">Accented/Composite</A> Char
  <DD>
    Only in the font and outline views.
    <P>
    If the shift key is not depressed when selecting the menu item this will
    only build accented letters, if the shift key is depressed it will build
    general composite characters (fractions, ligatures, digits inside parens,
    roman numerals, etc.) as well. If invoked by short-cut (Ctl-Shft-A) or mnemonic
    it will only build accented letters.
    <P>
    If the current character is an accented character (and all the base characters
    and accents have already been created) then this command will delete anything
    that is currently in the foreground and put a reference to the base character
    and another reference to the accent character into the foreground. So if
    the current character were "&Agrave;" then a reference to "A" would be added
    to it, and a reference to "`" would be centered above the "A". <BR>
    If <A HREF="editmenu.html#From">Copy From</A> is set to All Fonts then any
    bitmaps will have a similar process done (even in the outline character view).
    <P>
    Choosing accents can be a slightly tricky process. Unicode says that accented
    letters should be built out of the accents in the range 0x300-0x340, but
    this does not work too well in postscript. A Type1 font works better if the
    accented character is in the Adobe Standard Encoding, which means either
    using accents around 0x2d0 or ascii characters. Pfaedit will first attempt
    to find an accent around 0x2d0, then in ascii and finally in the 0x300-0x340
    range.
    <P>
    Not all accents should be centered above the base character, a cedilla is
    (usually) centered underneath the base, while other accents need to be placed
    to the left or right, or even overstruck. PfaEdit should know about proper
    placement of most accents.
    <P>
    Some Unicode characters contain more than one accent. Additional accents
    will be treated similarly. This command can also be used to generate more
    general composite characters (in the outline view). Unicode 0x2163 is the
    roman numeral IV and this command may be used to build it. Greek capital
    Alpha looks exactly like Latin capital A and can be created. On the other
    hand the oe ligature will be replaced by an "o" followed by "e", so be a
    little careful. Some accents (for example cedilla) are treated unexpectedly
    on certain letters (different ways in different languages), so be careful
    of g-cedilla. &Aring; often merges the ring into the top of the A, but here
    it will float above it. Be alert.
    <P>
    <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><SMALL>NOTE:</SMALL></STRONG></FONT> My centering
    algorithms attempt to guess what will look centered to the human eye (centering
    it in the middle of the character will often not look centered). You should
    examine all built characters and be prepared to adjust the accent.
    <P>
    The algorithms take some account of the italicangle
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Merge">Merge</A> Fonts...
  <DD>
    Only in the font view. If you are building a unicode font you will often
    want to merge in fonts with other encodings. You can, of course, cut and
    paste from one to the other, but usually that needs to be done one character
    at a time (because the encoding may not be ordered the same as Unicode).
    Instead, if your fonts are properly encoded (with proper unicode names),
    then the Merge Fonts command will put them into the right places in the current
    font.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Interpolate">Interpolate</A> Fonts...
  <DD>
    Only in the font view. If you have a bold font and a light font and would
    like to create a medium font, then you can interpolate a font between the
    two (or you can extrapolate a font that's even bolder or lighter). Your two
    fonts must have the same sets of characters, and each character must have
    the same number of paths (ordered similarly) and each path must have the
    same number of points on it, and must have the same references.
