    Typographic Features

    This sub-menu is only present in the font view and allows you to manipulate
    GSUB/GPOS/morx features. If you wish to create them you should use

      <DT>
	Default <A NAME="DefaultATT">ATT</A>
      <DD>
	In the font view this is a sub-menu which allows you to generate default

	tables.
	<P>
	The sub-menu consists of a list of feature names (and a few more generic
	names like "All" which will provide defaults for everything it can figure
	out, and "Ligatures" which will provide defaults for all ligatures). FontForge
	will look for defaults for all selected characters. There is also one special
	entry:

	  <DT>
	    Suffix to Tag...
	  <DD>
	    In adobe's glyph naming conventions, alternate forms of glyphs may be named
	    by appending a suffix to the normal glyph's name. Thus a swash variant of
	    "A" might be named "A.swash".
	    <P>
	    Using this command you can tell FontForge to associate a given suffix with
	    a feature tag. (in the above example you could associate ".swash" with 'swsh'
	    -- except you don't need to, because FontForge already knows about that one).
	    Select the letter "A", then enter the command, then "A" will be linked to
	    "A.swash" as a 'swsh'.

  <DT>
    Find <A NAME="Problems">Problems</A>...
  <DD>
    This command is not present in the bitmap view. It will search for several
    common problems. In the character view it will select anything that needs
    to be fixed, in the font view it will check all selected characters and if
    any have problems will open them and select the problems. It will post a
    message telling you of each problem found. It brings up the
    <A HREF="problems.html">Find Problem</A> dialog to let you choose what problems
    to look for.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Bitmaps">Bitmaps</A> Available...
  <DD>
    This brings up a list of pixel sizes for bitmap fonts.<BR>
    <IMG SRC="bitmapsavail.png" WIDTH="263" HEIGHT="366" ALIGN="Right"> If you
    have bitmap fonts this will show their pixel sizes. If you remove a size
    that is in the list then that font will be deleted from the sfd file. If
    you add a size then that size font will be created and stored in the sfd
    file.
    <P>
    FontForge deals in pixel sizes, not point sizes. The conversion between pixels
    and points differs on different systems and indeed on different screens.
    A point is (approximately) 1/72 of an inch, a pixel is however big a pixel
    happens to be on your screen. Usually pixels range from about 1/72 of an
    inch to about 1/144 of an inch. Different systems support different screen
    resolutions as "standard", and FontForge tries to know about these standards.

    <P>
    Sadly your screen will probably not match one of the standard screens precisely.
    On X the standard resolutions are 75 and 100dpi, on MS Windows 96 and 120dpi,
    and on the Mac 72dpi. This dialog provides the conversion between pixel size
    and point sizes at these resolutions.
    <P>
    Normally the new characters are created by rasterizing the outline font.
    If your system has the freetype2 library installed (and you checked the "Use
    FreeType" box) then FontForge will use the FreeType rasterizer to generate
    bitmaps, otherwise it will use FontForge's built-in rasterizer (which isn't
    as good, but involves a little less overhead).
    <P>
    Finally, if you have no outline font then the new characters will be created
    by scaling the (bitmap) font displayed in the font view.
    <P>
    In CID keyed fonts there will not be a set of bitmaps for each sub font,
    instead the entire complex of sub-fonts share bitmaps.<BR Clear=Right>
    <P>
    <IMG SRC="greymapsavail.png" WIDTH="263" HEIGHT="366" ALIGN="Right">FontForge
    also supports anti-aliased bitmap fonts, and you can use this dialog to generate
    them. If you want to generate a 12 point anti-aliased font with 8 bits per
    pixel you would type 12@8 into the dialog above. FontForge supports 1, 2,
    4 and 8 bit per pixel fonts (a 1 bit per pixel font is a standard bitmap,
    the others are greymaps).<BR>
    (New greymaps can not be created by scaling old greymaps, if you wish to
    generate a greymap font, you must have an outline font).
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Regenerate">Regenerate</A> Bitmaps...
  <DD>
    If you have changed the outline that a bitmap is based one then you should
    (at some point) look into changing the bitmap too. This command allows you
    to regenerate a subset of the characters in a given bitmap font. In the font
    view you can regenerate all selected characters, while in the bitmap and
    outline views you can regenerate the current character. You can pick what
    pixel sizes should be regenerated too (unlike the above command, removing
    a bitmap size from the regenerate list will not delete it).<BR>
    As before, if you wish to change a greymap you should refer to it by
    &lt;pixel-size&gt;@&lt;bits-per-pixel&gt;.

  <DT>
    <A NAME="NonLinear">Non Linear </A>Transform...
  <DD>
    This command is not available in the default build, you must modify the file
    <CODE>configure-fontforge.h</CODE> and then rebuild FontForge. This command
    allows the user to specify a non-linear transformation as a pair of expressions
    (the first specifies the transformation for the x coordinate, the second
    for the y coordinate). These expressions may be fairly general functions
    of x and y. See the <A HREF="scripting.html#NonLinear">scripting page</A>
    for a description of the syntax.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Expand">Expand</A> Stroke...
  <DD>
    Not in the bitmap view. In the font view it applies to all foreground splines
    in all selected characters. In the outline view it applies to all paths that
    have at least one point selected (or if no points are selected then it applies
    to all paths).<BR>
    <IMG SRC="twolines.png" WIDTH="247" HEIGHT="247">
    <IMG SRC="expandedlines.png" WIDTH="247" HEIGHT="247"><BR>
    Above is a simple example of what expand stroke can do. It takes the two
    open paths above left and turns them into the two closed paths right.<BR>
    <IMG SRC="expandstroke.png" WIDTH="323" HEIGHT="488" ALIGN="Left"><BR>
    The Expand Stroke dialog gives you control over various aspects of the expansion
    process. You can chose a stroke width, how the ends of an open path should
    be drawn, and how the path should look when two splines (or lines) join which
    do not have the same slope (ie. at a corner point). Or you may choose to
    have the path be that which would be traced by a calligraphic pen, or an
    elliptical pen. For closed contours you may also choose to remove either
    the generated contour which is inside the original, or that which is outside.

    <A NAME="TilePath">Tile Path</A>
  <DD>
    This command is not available in the default build, you must modify the file
    <CODE>configure-fontforge.h</CODE> and then rebuild FontForge. This command
    takes the contents of the clipboard and treats it as a tile which is applied
    to any selected contours.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Remove">Remove</A> Overlap
  <DD>
    Not in the bitmap view. If two closed paths intersect then there will be
    overlap. This will get rid of it, leaving one closed path behind.
    <P>
    Make sure paths have the correct orientation. Consider the letter "O" with
    two contours. If both contours run in the same direction then the inner path
    will be removed (because the outer path overlaps it everywhere), but if the
    contours run in oposite orientations then the inner path will be retained.
    Things get very strange if you have intersecting paths with different
    orientations.

    <IMG SRC="expandedlines.png" WIDTH="247" HEIGHT="247">
    <IMG SRC="overlappedlines.png" WIDTH="247" HEIGHT="247"><BR>
    This command is probably the buggiest in FontForge. So before FontForge invokes
    the command it will save the state to the error recovery file.<BR>

    which are close together can cause problems.

  <DT>
    Find Intersections
  <DD>
    This finds the places where overlapping contours intersect and inserts points
    at those locations.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Simplify">Simplify</A>
  <DD>
    Not in the bitmap view. If you have lots of points on a path, some of which
    do not materially add to the path's shape, then this command will remove
    the extraneous points. (It will not remove points where the slope at the
    point is horizontal or vertical as postscript likes to have these points
    present).
    <P>
    <A HREF="pfaeditmath.html#Approximating">How is this done?</A>
  <DT>
    Simplify More
  <DD>
    This is a variant of the simplify command, obtainable if you hold down the
    shift key when invoking from the menu. It brings up a dialog which gives
    you control over what sorts of errors this simplification is allowed to induce.
    You can control:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	How far the simplified contour is allowed to stray from the original
      <LI>
	Whether to allow removal of extreme points
      <LI>
	Whether to allow the slope to change at points.
      <LI>
	Whether to make corner points into curve points (by adjusting the control
	points)
      <LI>
	Whether to flatten small bumps off of lines
    </UL>
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Cleanup">Cleanup Char</A>
  <DD>
    This is similar to the simplify command. In this case if there is a spline
    which actually traces out a line but none the less has control points, then
    this command will remove the control points.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Add-Extrema">Add Extrema</A>
  <DD>
    Not in the bitmap view. In the font view (or if nothing is selected in the
    outline view) it will look at each spline in the character and find where
    the extrema are and insert points at those locations (assuming there aren't
    points there already). If there are points selected in the outline view then
    it will only work on splines which are between two selected points.

    <A NAME="Align">Align</A> menu
  <DD>
    This submenu is only present in the outline view, it allows you to align
    points or to space them out along an axis.
    <DL>
      <DT>
	<A NAME="Average">Average</A> Points
      <DD>
	This will look at all the selected points and find the coordinate with the
	least change. Then it will average find the median point on that axis and
	set all the selected points to have that value for the appropriate
	coordinate.<BR>
	So if you have a line which is almost horizontal, and select its endpoints
	and apply this command it will be horizontal.<BR>

	(if you select exactly two points, and they lie close to a 45 diagonal, then
	they will be forced to the diagonal rather than to horizontal/vertical)
      <DT>
	<A NAME="Space-Pts">Space Points</A>
      <DD>
	If you have three or more points selected then FontForge will figure out
	the coordinate that has the greatest change and will space the points out
	regularly along that axis.<BR>
	If you select one point (and that point is in the middle of a path) then
	(internally) the point's location will be expressed in a coordinate system
	which is rotated so that one axis is parallel to the line between the two
	points that surround the selected point. The selected point will be moved
	mid-way between the two on this axis, while it's other coordinate remains
	fixed.<BR>
	That's an extremely complicated way of saying: If the selected point is connected
	to two points which are on a horizontal line, then the selected point's x
	coordinate will be midway between the two, while its y coordinate remains
	unchanged.<BR>

      <DT>
	<A NAME="Space-Regions">Space Regions</A>
      <DD>
	This is similar to the above command except that it allows you to make a
	rather simple definition of a collection of points which should be moved
	together. Each of these regions will be regularly spaced along the chosen
	axis. A region is defined as a collection of points, each one of which is
	within some maximum distance of at least one other point in the region. The
	purpose of this is to allow you to space out the stems of the letter "m"
	so that they regularly spaced horizontally. Sadly it won't work in many cases
	because in a serifed font the serifs will often be closer to each other than
	to their respective stems.<BR>

      <DT>
	Make <A NAME="Parallel">Parallel</A>
      <DD>
	If four points are selected, and there are two lines between them, then FontForge
	will make those lines parallel. If there are four lines between them (ie.
	they form a quadrilateral, then FontForge will turn it into a parallelogram.
	(note, this only works on lines, not on curved splines)<BR>
	The last point selected will be the one moved (sometimes FontForge doesn't
	remember which point was selected last, then it will just pick one randomly.
	If you don't want that to happen, select your points and then single click
	on the one you want moved).
    </DL>
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Round">Round</A> to Int
  <DD>
    Not in the bitmap view. FontForge stores point locations as real numbers
    (ie. it retains fractional values). TrueType and PostScript Type1 only support
    integral values (Well with vast effort Type1 fonts can be made to support
    real numbers but FontForge doesn't), so when generating the font points are
    rounded to integral values. Open Type allows real numbers easily. But they
    make the font file bigger. This command will round all selected locations
    to the closest integer.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Order">Order</A>
  <DD>
    This changes the order in which contours, references and images are drawn.
    It is almost useless because this order of contours and references does not
    affect the final appearance of the character. The only relevance it has is
    when interpolating fonts and in multiple master fonts. Here similar contours
    must appear in the same order.
    <P>
    If you have a character which contains both contours and references, FontForge
    does not specify whether references or contours are drawn first (or whether
    the two are intermixed). If this matters to you, unlink your references.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Clockwise">Clockwise</A>
  <DD>
    Only in the outline view. If all selected paths have a clockwise direction
    then this will be checked. Selecting it will make all paths be clockwise.
    <P>
    If not paths are selected, or if all selected paths are open this will be
    greyed out. I a selected path intersects itself results are indeterminate.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Counter">Counter</A>-Clockwise
  <DD>
    Only in the outline view. If all selected paths have a counter-clockwise
    direction then this will be checked. Selecting it will make all paths be
    counter-clockwise.
    <P>
    If not paths are selected, or if all selected paths are open this will be
    greyed out. I a selected path intersects itself results are indeterminate.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Correct">Correct</A> Direction
  <DD>
    Not in the bitmap view. Sets the direction of outermost paths to be clockwise.
    The next path crossed will be made counter-clockwise, the next clockwise,
    etc.<BR>
    This command may produce unexpected results if two splines cross.<BR>
    If a character contains a flipped reference, this command will be unable
    to correct the contours inside of the reference directly, instead it will
    offer to unlink the reference after which it can treat its (former) contours
    like any others.
  <DT>
    Build <A NAME="Accented">Accented/Composite</A> Char
  <DD>
    Not in the bitmap view.
    <P>
    The first menu item will only build accented letters, the second will build
    general composite characters (fractions, ligatures, digits inside parens,
    roman numerals, etc.) as well.
    <P>
    If the current character is an accented character (and all the base characters
    and accents have already been created) then this command will delete anything
    that is currently in the foreground and put a reference to the base character
    and another reference to the accent character into the foreground. So if
    the current character were "&Agrave;" then a reference to "A" would be added
    to it, and a reference to "`" would be centered above the "A". <BR>
    If <A HREF="editmenu.html#From">Copy From</A> is set to All Fonts then any
    bitmaps will have a similar process done (even in the outline character
    view).<BR>
    A more complete description is given in the section on
    <A HREF="accented.html">accented characters</A>.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Merge">Merge</A> Fonts...
  <DD>
    Only in the font view. If you are building a unicode font you will often
    want to merge in fonts with other encodings. You can, of course, cut and
    paste from one to the other, but usually that needs to be done one character
    at a time (because the encoding may not be ordered the same as Unicode).
    Instead, if your fonts are properly encoded (with proper unicode names),
    then the Merge Fonts command will put them into the right places in the current
    font.
    <P>
    FontForge does the following when merging CID-keyed fonts:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	If the font in the window (the mergee) is a normal font and the other font
	(the merger) is a CID keyed font, then the merger font is effectively flattened
	and the result merged into the mergee.
      <LI>
	If the mergee is a CID keyed font and the merger font is a normal font then
	the merger font will be merged into whichever of the mergee's subfonts is
	currently active.
      <LI>
	If both are CID keyed fonts, then they should:
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    Have the same registry and ordering
	  <LI>
	    The supplement number of the mergee should be at least as big as that of
	    the merger
	  <LI>
	    The mergee should have at least as many subfonts as the merger.
	</UL>
	<P>
	If these conditions be met then any CIDs from the merger which are not present
	in the mergee will be merged into the same subfont of the mergee as they
	came from in the merger.
	<P>
	This strikes me as somewhat problematic, but I can't think of a better solution.
    </UL>
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Interpolate">Interpolate</A> Fonts...
  <DD>
    Only in the font view. If you have a bold font and a light font and would
    like to create a medium font, then you can interpolate a font between the
    two (or you can extrapolate a font that's even bolder or lighter). Your two
    fonts must have the same sets of characters, and each character must have
    the same number of paths (ordered similarly) and each path must have the
    same number of points on it, and must have the same references.
