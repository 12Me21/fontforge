  Outline Character View
</H1>
<P>
<IMG SRC="charview2.png" WIDTH="544" HEIGHT="656">
<P>
The outline character view is the window in which most editing happens.
<P>
At the top of the window, underneath the menu bar is an information line.
The first item is the location of the mouse pointer (in the internal coordinate
system of the character). If there is a single selected point then the next
item gives its location, and the next three are, respectively, the offsets
from the selected point to the current location, the distance from the selected
point, and the angle from the horizontal (measured counter-clockwise). Then
we have the current scale factor, and the layer which is active. Finally
(in the debugging view) is an indication of whether the instruction pointer
is in the glyph program, the 'prep' program of the 'fpgm'.
<P>
Underneath the information is a ruler showing the current pointer location
as a red line. There's a similar ruler on the left side.
<P>
Underneath that is the character itself. On the left edge of the screen is
a grey line indicating the x=0 line, further right is a black line showing
where the character's width is currently set. There are also grey lines showing
the ascent, descent and baseline.
<P>
Background images and background splines are drawn in grey. Grid lines are
also drawn in grey. Vertical hinting regions are drawn in light blue, Horizontal
hints are drawn in light green. If any hints overlap the boundaries are drawn
in cyan.
<P>
The points of the character are of three types, corner points drawn as filled
squares, curve points drawn as filled circles and tangent points drawn as
filled triangles. If a point is selected then it will be drawn as an outlined
square, circle or triangle and its control points are drawn as little magenta
or dull-cyan xs at the end of a similarly colored line. (in a curved point
the control points will be collinear). (the "Next" control point will be
drawn dull cyan, and the Prev point will be magenta).
<P>
The initial point in a contour will be drawn in green, and beside it will
be a tiny arrow pointing in the direction of the contour.
<P>
Sometimes it is important to know which points are at the extrema of splines
(postscript likes for there to be points at the extrema of all splines),
if this is important to you set the "Mark Extrema" flag in the View menu.
After that points at extrema will show up as dull purple.
<P>
There are also two palettes, one, a layer palette, allowing you to control
<A HREF="#Layers">which layers are visible</A>, and one, a tool palette,
from which you <A HREF="#Tools">may pick editing tools</A>. Normally these
are free floating windows, but you may choose to dock them in the window
with View-&gt;Palettes-&gt;Dock Palettes.
<P>
You select an editing tool by clicking on the appropriate button on the tools
palette, or you may depress the right mouse button and select a tool from
a popup menu (you may also change layers and do a few other things with this
menu). There are four different tools bindings available to you (this may
be a complication with no utility). The left mouse button has a tool bound
to it, and this tool will be displayed when the program is idle. If you hold
down the control key, another tool is available, by default this is a pointer
but if you click on the tools palette with the control key down you can select
something else. If you depress the middle mouse button you get a third tool
(by default a magnifying glass), and the control key and middle button give
you the fourth (a ruler).
<P>
If the mouse pointer is close to a point (within a few pixels) when you depress
the mouse, then the effective location of the press will be the location
of the point.
<P>
If you drag a character from the font view and drop it into a character view
then FontForge will drop a reference to the dragged character into the view.
<H2>
  <A NAME="Layers">Layers</A>
</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="layers.png" WIDTH="108" HEIGHT="219" ALIGN="Left"> There are several
layers in the outline view, three of which are editable. Each layer has a
check box (indicating whether it is visible or not) and the editable layers
also have a radio button (indicating whether it is editable).
<P>
You may use the indicated mnemonics to change the editable layer (even if
the focus is not in the layers window).
<P>
The first is the foreground layer, this contains the splines that actually
make up the character that will be placed into the font.
<P>
The second is the background layer, this contains background images and splines.
These do not go into the font, but may be helpful to you in tracing the outline
of your character. It is possible to paste an image into the background if
you have an image manipulation program that supports selection by mime type
(the kde family of applications does this, perhaps others), then FontForge
will be able to read images in either "image/png" or "image/bmp".
<P>
The third layer is a set of guide lines/splines. These are common to all
characters in the font. A few lines are provided for you (the x=0 line, the
ascent, descent and baseline). Other handy lines might be the x-height of
the font, the cap-height, ascender-height, descender-height, ... When you
are working in any of the other layers, points will snap to splines in this
layer (making it easy to force a consistent x-height for example).
<P>
The next 4 entries control what hints for this character are visible. Most
hints may be created with the <CODE>Hints-&gt;AutoHint</CODE> command, the
presence of hints will sometimes improve rasterization. The blues entry displays
the BlueValues zones. These may be set with <CODE>Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;PS
Private</CODE>.
<P>
The Anchors entry controls what whether anchor points are displayed.
<P>
The last two entries control whether the horizontal or vertical metrics for
the character are visible. When editing Latin (Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic,
etc.) glyphs only horizontal metrics are generally present. When editing
Chinese, Japanese, Korean fonts both horizontal and vertical metrics are
needed. By default vertical metrics are not available, if you want them go
to
<A HREF="fontinfo.html#vertical"><CODE>Element-&gt;FontInfo-&gt;General</CODE></A>.
<H2>
  <A NAME="Tools">Tools</A>
</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="tools.png" WIDTH="57" HEIGHT="287" ALIGN="Left"> There are 16 different
editing tools of which two (rectangle/ellipse and polygon/star) come in two
forms.
<P>
At the bottom of the palette is a list of the current bindings of the mouse
buttons. Here mouse button 1 is bound to the pointer tool, mouse button 1
with the control key pressed is also bound to pointer, mouse button 2 is
bound to magnify, and mouse button 2 with control is bound to ruler.
<H3>
  <IMG SRC="cvarrowicon.png" ALIGN="Middle">The pointer tool
</H3>
<P>
This tool is used for selecting points, images and referenced characters.
It can also move these and scale images and referenced characters.
<P>
Only things that are in the layer that is currently editable may be selected
or moved or scaled.
<P>
A simple click on an unselected point selects it and deselects everything
else. A shift click on a point toggles whether that point is selected or
not. A double click selects all points on the path containing that point.
Clicking on the background will deselect everything. Clicking on the background
and dragging out a rectangle will select everything within the rectangle.
Clicking on a line or spline will select the two end points of that line
or spline. Clicking on the dark part of an image (when in the background
layer) will select the image. Clicking on the outline of a referenced character
will select that reference (if a reference character happens to have the
same outline and bounding box, then holding down the meta key will allow
you to move it once it is selected, without the meta key you will resize
it).
<P>
If a point has no visible control points, then they are at the same location
as the point itself. If you want to select one of the control points then
first select the point (to make the control points active) then hold down
the meta key and depress the mouse on the point. This should allow you to
drag one of the control points (if you get the wrong point the first time
drag it out of the way, repeat the process to get the other control and then
put the first one back). Sadly some window managers (gnome-sawtooth for one)
will steal meta-clicks. If this happens you will need to use Element-&gt;Get
Info to set the control points.
<P>
Once something is selected you may drag it around. If you select something
and drag the mouse then it and everything else selected will be moved. If
you drag an open path and one of the end points happens to fall on the end
point of another open path, then the two will be merged into one. If you
drag a control point then it will be moved.
<P>
If you selected a spline, then dragging it will drag the location on the
spline where you pressed the mouse (so you are changing the shape of the
spline).
<P>
If you hold the shift key down when you drag then the motion will be constrained
to be either horizontal, vertical, or at a 45&#176; angle. (When moving control
points the combination of shift and meta (alt) will mean that the control
point is constrained to be the same angle from the base point as it was before
you started moving it).
<P>
If your font has an ItalicAngle set, and the ItalicConstrain preference item
is set, then motion that would normally be constrained to the vertical is
constrained to be along the ItalicAngle.
<P>
If you move the mouse to the bounding box of a selected image or reference
character and drag it then you will scale that object.
<P>
If you move the mouse to the <A NAME="set-width">width</A> line, then dragging
it will change the width of the current character. If there are any bitmaps
of this character then their widths will also be updated. If there are any
other characters which depend on this character (ie. include this character
as a reference) and their width was the same as the character's, then their
widths will also be updated (so if you change the width of A, then the width
of &Agrave;, &Aacute;, &Acirc;, &Atilde;, &Auml; and &Aring; might also be
changed).
<P>
It is also possible to use the arrow keys to move selected items around.
Each arrow will move the selection one em-unit (this can be changed in
preferences to be any number of em-units) in the obvious direction. The selection
may include the width (right bearing) line (or vertical with line). If the
last thing you selected was a control point then that point will be moved.
If you hold down the shift key at the same time the up and down arrows will
move parallel to the italic angle (be careful of this: this leads to non-integral
values). If you hold down the meta (alt) key, then the motion will be 10
times the normal amount.
<P>
If you hold down the control key while working with the arrows then the view
will be scrolled rather than moving the selection.
<P>
If the character is a ligature (and has a ligature entry in Char Info) then
it has the potential of having "ligature caret locations". Essentially this
means that between each ligature component it is possible to place a caret
location (so that the word processor will place be able to place a caret
between each component of the ligature). In a ligature window a series of
vertical lines will be drawn across the screen at the caret locations. By
default these lines will be placed at the origin, but you may move one by
placing the mouse pointer on it, depressing the button and dragging the line
around. See the description on <A HREF="editexample4.html#ligature">building
a ligature </A>for a more complete description.
<H3>
  <IMG SRC="cvmagicon.png" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="26" ALIGN="Middle">The magnifying
  tool
</H3>
<P>
Clicking with the magnifying tool will magnify the view and center it around
the point you clicked on. Holding down the Alt (Meta) key and clicking will
minify the view, again centered around the point at which you clicked. Again
some window managers will steal meta-clicks, so you may have to use the View
menu to minify (It's called Zoom Out
<P>
If you drag out a rectangle with this tool then when you release, FontForge
will shift and scale the view so that your rectangle just fits into the window.
<P>
If your mouse has a scroll wheel then holding down the control key with the
scroll wheel causes it to magnify or minify the window.
<H3>
  <IMG SRC="cvhandicon.png" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="26" ALIGN="Middle">The hand
  tool
</H3>
<P>
You can use this tool to scroll the window without using the scroll bars.
<H3>
  <IMG SRC="cvfreehandicon.png" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="26" ALIGN="Middle"><IMG
      SRC="freehandctl.png" ALIGN="Right" WIDTH="224" HEIGHT="311">The
  <A NAME="freehand">freehand</A> tool
</H3>
<P>
You can use this tool to draw a random curve which FontForge will then attempt
to convert into a set of splines. If you hold down the Alt (Meta) key then
FontForge will close the curve when you release the mouse.
<P>
If you double click on the icon in the tool palette you get a dialog similar
to the <A HREF="elementmenu.html#Expand">Element-&gt;Expand Stroke</A> which
will give you more control over the results. You can:
<UL>
  <LI>
    have the output be the path you traced out
  <LI>
    have the output be the region you would trace if you used a ball-point pen
    with a large ball
  <LI>
    have the output be the region you would trace if you used a calligraphic
    pen.
</UL>
<P>
If you have a <A HREF="wacom.html">wacom</A> graphics tablet you can configure
these pens to have variable sizes depending on the amount of pressure you
apply to the stylus. Simply move the stylus around in the two boxes using
the amount of pressure appropriate for the corresponding pen-size (Stroke
Width)<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<H3>
  <IMG SRC="cvcurveicon.png" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="26" ALIGN="Middle">
  <IMG SRC="cvcornericon.png" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="26" ALIGN="Middle">
  <IMG SRC="cvtangenticon.png" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="26" ALIGN="Middle">Tools
  for adding curved, corner and tangent points.
</H3>
<P>
These three tools behave similarly, differing only in what kind of point
is added to the view.
<P>
If a single point is selected, and if that point is at the end of a path
then depressing the mouse button will create a new point where the mouse
was depressed and draw a spline from the selected point to new point. If
this new location happens to be the end of a path then the two paths will
be joined (or if it is the end of the current path then the path will be
closed).
<P>
Otherwise if the mouse is depressed while being on a spline then a point
will be added to that spline.
<P>
Otherwise a new point is created not on any path at the location of the press.
<P>
Once the point has been created then it becomes selected and all others are
deselected. You may drag the point around, and if the point is on an open
path and you drag it to the end point of another open path then the two paths
will be joined.
<P>
If you double click then a point will be added as above and a
<A HREF="getinfo.html">Point Info</A> dlg will appear to give you fine control
over the location of the point and its control points.
<H3>
  <IMG SRC="cvpenicon.png" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="26" ALIGN="Middle">The pen tool
</H3>
<P>
In many ways this is similar to the tools above, the only differences are
that the points created are curved points, they are initially created with
the control points on the point and as you drag you drag out the control
points rather than moving the point itself around.
<H3>
  <IMG SRC="cvknifeicon.png" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="26" ALIGN="Middle">The knife
  tool
</H3>
<P>
This tool is used to cut splines. As you drag it across the view fontforge
draws a line showing where the cut will happen. When you release, every spline
you intersect will be cut-- that is at the location where this line intersects
the spline two new points will be created and the old spline will be split
in two connecting to the two new end points. These endpoints are not joined,
so the spline is now open (or if it were previously open, it is now cut in
two).
<H3>
  <IMG SRC="cvrulericon.png" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="26" ALIGN="Middle">The
  <A NAME="Ruler">ruler</A> tool
</H3>
<P>
This tool tells you the x-y offsets, distance and angle from the point where
you depressed the mouse to the mouse's current location. If you depress the
tool at the end point of a spline and move it to the other endpoint then
it will also show the length of that spline.
<P>
If you hold down the Meta (Alt) key when the mouse button is up, then the
current location will be shown more accurately than on the status line.
<P>
Finally if you hold down the Meta (Alt) key when you release the mouse button,
then the ruler window will remain on the screen until you dismiss it by either:
clicking in the window, or dragging out a new ruler selection.
<H3>
  <IMG SRC="cvscaleicon.png" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="26" ALIGN="Middle">The scale
  tool
</H3>
<P>
This tool allows you to scale the selection by eye rather than by a set amount
(if there is no selection then everything in the current layer will be scaled).
The location of the press will be the origin of the transformation, the further
you move the point up and to the right the more it will be scaled in that
dimension. If you want the scaling to be uniform or only in one dimension
then hold down the shift key.
<P>
Double clicking on this will bring up the transform dialog with the "Scale..."
option selected.
<H3>
  <IMG SRC="cvflipicon.png" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="26" ALIGN="Middle">The flip
  tool
</H3>
<P>
This tool allows you to flip the selection either horizontally or vertically.
Again the point at which you press the mouse is the origin of the transformation.
<P>
Double clicking on this will bring up the transform dialog with the "Flip..."
option selected.
<H3>
  <IMG SRC="cvrotateicon.png" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="26" ALIGN="Middle">The rotate
  tool
</H3>
<P>
This tools allows you to rotate the selection freely.
<P>
Double clicking on this will bring up the transform dialog with the "Rotate..."
option selected.
<H3>
  <IMG SRC="cvskewicon.png" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="26" ALIGN="Middle">The skew
  tool
</H3>
<P>
This tool allows you to skew the selection.
<P>
Double clicking on this will bring up the transform dialog with the "Skew..."
option selected.
<H3>
  <IMG SRC="cvrecticon.png" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="26" ALIGN="Middle">
  <IMG SRC="cvellipseicon.png" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="26" ALIGN="Middle">The
  rectangle/ellipse tool
</H3>
<P>
By default this produces a rectangle, single-clicking on the tool palette
will toggle between rectangle and ellipse, and double clicking in the tools
palette gives you a dialog which allows you to control whether your rectangles
are drawn with round corners, and how both rectangles and ellipses are specified.
<P>
You can choose whether the rectangle (or ellipse) will be drawn between the
point where you depressed the mouse on the view and the point where you released
it (bounding box), or whether the point where you depress the mouse becomes
the center of the rectangle and the point where you release it provides an
end-point (center out).
<P>
If you want even more control, you can double click in the character view
and get another dialog which allows you to define numerically where the
rectangle/ellipse should be placed, how big it should be, and whether it
should be rotated.
<H3>
  <IMG SRC="cvpolyicon.png" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="26" ALIGN="Middle">
  <IMG SRC="cvstaricon.png" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="26" ALIGN="Middle">The polygon/star
  tool
</H3>
<P>
By default this draws a regular polygon, but by double clicking on the button
in the tools palette you can make it draw a star, or select the number of
verteces in your polygon.
<P>
The polygon is drawn as though it were inscribed in the circle whose center
is the point where you depressed the mouse and whose radius is the distance
between the press point and the release point. One of the polygon's verteces
will be at the release point.
<P>
A star is drawn similarly. It will be a star generated from a regular polygon.
As the number of verteces of the polygon gets larger the star will look more
and more like a circle, for this reason the dialog box that allows you to
pick the number of verteces will also allow you to pick how far the star's
points should extend beyond the circle in which the polygon is inscribed
(this will make a non-regular star, but it might look nicer).
<H2>
  <A NAME="Vertical">Vertical View</A>
</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="charview-vert.png" WIDTH="544" HEIGHT="563" ALIGN="Right"> In this
view the vertical metrics of the character are shown. You can change the
vertical advance just as you changed the character's width (by selecting
the pointer tool and dragging the vertical advance line up or
down).<BR Clear=Right>

  <A NAME="GridFit">Grid Fit View</A>
</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="GridFit.png" WIDTH="327" HEIGHT="368" ALIGN="Right">If you have
the freetype library, then you can see the results of rasterizing your character.
If you have freetype's bytecode interpreter enabled you can also see how
the truetype instructions in the character have moved the points around (if
you don't have the bytecode interpreter enabled you will see what freetype's
autohinter does to points). This mode can be invoked with View-&gt;Show Grid
Fit...
<P>
The Show Grid Fit command will ask you for some basic information first.
It needs to know the pointsize and resolution for which you want the action
performed (the example at right is 12pt on a 72dpi screen).<BR>

  <IMG SRC="cvdebug.png" WIDTH="544" HEIGHT="563" ALIGN="Right">The
  <A NAME="Debugging">Debugging</A> View
</H2>
<P>
FontForge has a truetype debugger -- provided you have a version of freetype
on your machine with the bytecode interpreter enabled
<FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>(Note: you need a license from Apple to enable
this. It is protected by several patents)</STRONG></FONT>.
<P>
The image to the right shows an example of this mode. You invoke it with
Hints-&gt;Debug, and as with the grid-fit view above you must establish a
pointsize and and resolution. The view divides into two panes, the left of
which is similar to the grid fit view above (except that it changes as you
step through the instructions), the right pane provides a list of the
instructions to be executed.
<P>
In addition to showing you all the points in your glyph there are either
2 or 4 additional points. These are the so-called "phantom" points and represent
the horizontal and vertical metrics of the glyph (old versions of freetype
will only display 2 points -- left side bearing and advance width, while
newer versions will display top side bearing and advance height as well).
<P>
There are a series of buttons at the top of the instruction view. The first
will single step the truetype program (step into), the second will step over
procedure calls, the third will set a break point at the return point for
the current function and continue until that is hit, and the fourth will
continue until:
<UL>
  <LI>
    It hits a break point
  <LI>
    It hits a watch point
  <LI>
    It reaches the end of the glyph program
  <LI>
    An error occurs
</UL>
<P>
The red "STOPPED" arrow shows the current location of the instruction pointer
(and what instruction will be executed next).
<P>
The fifth button allows you to set a watch point. You select a point (or
several points) in the left hand pane, and press this button. Thereafter,
whenever one of those points is moved FontForge will stop the glyph program.
<P>
Flaw: FontForge only allows you to select a single control point (multiple
on-curve points, but only one control point) so currently there is no good
way to watch several control points.
<P>
You can set a more conventional break point by clicking on an instruction.
A little red stop sign will appear on top of the address area, and the program
will halt when the instruction pointer reaches that instruction. Clicking
on the instruction again will remove the breakpoint.
<P>
Flaw: Currently there is no way to set breakpoints outside of the current
function.
<P>
Flaw: Currently there is no way to examine the call stack.
<P>
The sixth button brings up a menu with which you can control which of various
debugging palettes are visible. The ones available so far are:

The Hints-&gt;Debug menu command can also be used to exit the debugger (by
turning off the debug check box), or to restart the debugger with different
