<DL>
  <DT>
    <A NAME="New">New</A>
  <DD>
    Creates a new font with (by default) ISO 8859-1 (Latin1) encoding. The default
    encoding may be changed in the preference dlg.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Open">Open</A>
  <DD>
    Brings up a file chooser and allows you to open a font in any of the formats
    PfaEdit understands.
    <P>
    If you open a truetype font all character hinting (instructions) will be
    lost. If the truetype font contains bitmaps then you will be asked if you
    want to load some of the bitmaps as well as the outlines.
    <P>
    By default this dialog will display all files with extensions of pfa, pfb,
    sfd, ttf, otf, gsf, ttc, ik, mf and bdf (possibly others as PfaEdit comes
    to support more formats). If you would also like it to display .ps files
    then enter *.{pfa,pfb,ttf,otf,bdf,sfd,ps} and press the Filter button. If
    you only want it to display sfd files enter *.sfd and press Filter.<BR>
    You may select multiple files (by holding down the shift or control keys
    when clicking on them), and all selected files will be opened.<BR>
    PfaEdit can open macbinary resource files containing postscript and truetype
    fonts (it does not open bitmap fonts currently)<BR>
    PfaEdit does not open Acorn RISC/OS files, but you can use
    <I><A HREF="acorn2sfd.html">acorn2sfd</A></I> to convert them into an sfd
    file which PfaEdit can then open.<BR>
    If you have <A HREF="http://www.tug.org/"><I>mf </I></A>and
    <I><A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/autotrace/">autotrace</A>
    </I>installed on your machine PfaEdit will process metafont's mf files for
    you. But you might want to use <I>pktrace, mftrace</I> or some other standalone
    program to do the job.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Recent">Recent</A>
  <DD>
    A submenu showing recently used sfd files.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Close">Close</A>
  <DD>
    Closes the current window.
    <P>
    If this is a font view and the font has been changed, then it will ask whether
    you want to save the font. It will also close any outline character, bitmap
    character or metrics views associated with the font.
  <DT>
    Open <A NAME="Outline">Outline</A>
  <DD>
    In the font view this will open outline views on all selected characters
    (if there are more than 15 or so it will ask whether you really meant to
    do that).
    <P>
    In the bitmap view it will open an outline view on the current character.
    <P>
    In the metrics view it will open an outline view on whatever character is
    active.
    <P>
    This menu item is always grey in an outline view.
    <P>
    Note: It is possible to have more than one window displaying the same character.
    Any editing that occurs in one should be reflected in all.
  <DT>
    Open <A NAME="Bitmap">Bitmap</A>
  <DD>
    In the font view this will open bitmap views on all selected characters (if
    there are more than 15 or so it will ask whether you really meant to do that).
    If the font view is displaying a bitmap then it will open a bitmap view showing
    that pixelsize, otherwise it will pick a pixelsize.
    <P>
    In the outline view it will open a bitmap view on the current character.
    It will pick a pointsize.
    <P>
    In the metrics view it will open an outline view on whatever character is
    active, as with the font view, if it is displaying a bitmap it will use its
    pixelsize, otherwise it will pick a pixelsize.
    <P>
    This menu item is always grey in an bitmap view.
    <P>
    Note: It is possible to have more than one window displaying the same character.
    Any editing that occurs in one should be reflected in all.
  <DT>
    Open <A NAME="Metrics">Metrics</A>
  <DD>
    In the font view it will open a metrics view displaying all selected characters.
    The new metrics view will display whatever the font view displays (outline
    or bitmap).
    <P>
    In the outline view it will open a metrics view displaying the current character.
    The display will be an outline.
    <P>
    In the bitmap view it will open a metrics view displaying the current character.
    The display will be a bitmap in the current size.
    <P>
    This menu item is always grey in the metrics view.
    <P>
    It is possible to have more than one metrics view open at a time.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Save">Save</A>
  <DD>
    Saves the current file. If it is associated with a spline font database it
    will be saved there and a backup file will be created. If it is a new font,
    or if the font has been read from a postscript font file, then a Save As
    dialog will pop up.
    <P>
    If you are editing a font "Ambrosia.sfd" then the backup file will be called
    "Ambrosia~.sfd".
  <DT>
    <A NAME="SaveAs">Save</A> As...
  <DD>
    Allows you to give a new name to the current spline font database. Pops up
    a file picker.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="SaveAll">Save All</A>
  <DD>
    Saves all changed fonts. If any have not been named, it will pop up a Save
    As file picker for that font.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Generate">Generate</A> Fonts...
  <DD>
    <A HREF="generate.html">This generates font files</A>, both outline and bitmap.
    You may choose not to generate either, you may generate an afm file or a
    pfm file, you may select the type of postscript output, you may select which
    pixelsizes of bitmap to generate. (See <A HREF="generate.html">that page
    </A>for more info)
  <DT>
    <A NAME="GenerateMac">Generate</A> Mac Family...
  <DD>
    This is only available if there are multiple fonts open in the same family,
    and if the current font is the "Plain" style of that family. It generates
    a mac FOND structure containing references to all family members, NFNT, sfnt,
    and POST resources for all selected faces. It brings up a
    <A HREF="generate.html">dlg</A> very similar to the Generate fonts dialog,
    but one that includes a list of all potential faces for family members.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Revert">Revert</A>
  <DD>
    Rereads the font from the file on the disk. All changes are lost.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Export">Export</A>...
  <DD>
    In the Outline view this allows you to export the splines that make up the
    character into an encapsulated postscript (.eps) file or a file in xfig format
    (.fig -- the conversion to fig format is not the best). You may also have
    the character rasterized and output in either .xbm or .bmp formats (PfaEdit
    will prompt you for a pixelsize. bmp also allows you to generate an anti-aliased
    image, and you will be prompted for bits per pixel. 1 bit per pixel is a
    bitmap).
    <P>
    In the Bitmap view this allows you to export the current character as either
    a .xbm or a .bmp (always as a bitmap) file.
    <P>
    This menu item is not available in the Font or Metrics Views.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Import">Import</A>...
  <DD>
    In the Font View this allows you to import one or several bitmap fonts (from
    a .bdf file or a ttf/otf/ttc file, TeX pk file, or an X11 .pcf file) and
    merge it into the list of bitmap sizes stored in the database. You may also
    load one bitmap font into the backgrounds of the outline characters (So "A"
    from the bitmap font goes into the background of the "A" outline character),
    this is to make tracing characters easier. Be careful, you need to load a
    big bitmap for autotrace to be useful.
    <FONT COLOR="Red"><SMALL><STRONG>NOTE: </STRONG></SMALL></FONT>PfaEdit is
    unable to read an encoding from pk files, you will may need to set it with
    "Force Encoding" after you've loaded the pk file.<BR>
    You may also load images into the character backgrounds. There are two ways
    to do this, you may either select several image files and they will be loaded
    consecutively into selected characters, or you may select an image template
    and all images whose filename match that template will be loaded into the
    backgrounds of the appropriate characters. Image templates look like "uni*.png"
    or "enc*.gif" or "cid*.tiff". You select the template by selecting a filename
    which matches that template-- So if you select "uni1100.gif" then all image
    files which start with "uni" and end with ".gif" and contain a valid unicode
    number will be loaded and placed in the appropriate place. Files named "enc*"
    or "cid*" are handled similarly except that they specify the current encoding
    (and the number must be in decimal rather than hex).
    <P>
    <SMALL>PfaEdit does best when given <A NAME="bitmapfiles">bitmap</A> images. It will grey out the
    foreground and make the background transparent. It will also compress them
    when it stores them in the sfd file. It will handle most other image formats
    but does not try to optimize them in anyway. Please use bitmaps here.</SMALL>
    <P>
    Finally you may load an encapsulated postscript file (or rather the sub-set
    of postscript that PfaEdit understands) into the foreground of characters.
    As with images above this may either import depending on the selection or
    a template.
    <P>
    In the Outline View this allows you to import an image into the background (see the above remark about <A HREF="#bitmapfiles">bitmaps</A>,
    or import eps or fig files into the foreground (the xfig conversion is really
    bad, the eps conversion is very limitted).
    <P>
    In the Bitmap View this allows you to import a bitmap image into the character.
    <P>
    This menu item is not available in the Metrics View<BR>
    &nbsp; <BR>
    In the font view you may select multiple files (by holding down the shift
    or control keys when clicking on them), and all selected bitmap fonts will
    be imported into the sfd.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Merge-kern">Merge Kern Info...</A>
  <DD>
    Only available in the font view window. This command will allow you to search
    for an afm (or tfm) file containing kerning pairs for the specified font.
    In many cases it will not be needed because when PfaEdit opens a .pfa or
    .pfb font it will automagically search for an appropriate .afm file in the
    same place. But sometimes afm files are stored in other directories. And
    sometimes you want to import information from TeX.<BR>
    <FONT COLOR="Red"><SMALL><STRONG>NOTE: </STRONG></SMALL></FONT>PfaEdit is
    unable to read an encoding from tfm files, it is your responsibility to ensure
    that the encoding of your font matches that of the tfm file <EM>BEFORE</EM>
    merging kerning information. This is unfortunate, sorry.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Print">Print</A>...
  <DD>
    Not available in the bitmap view. Allows you to print out all the characters
    in the font, a text sample of the font, or specific characters at a very
    large scale.<BR>
    See the section on <A HREF="print.html">printing</A> for more information.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Display">Display</A>...
  <DD>
    Not available in the bitmap view. Similar to print, except it displays what
    you will see on the screen. You must have freetype on your system for it
    to be of any use. See the section on <A HREF="display.html">display</A> for
    more information.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Execute">Execute</A> Script...
  <DD>
    Only in the font view. Brings up a dlg and allows you to enter a
    <A HREF="scripting.html">script</A>, which could be just calling a prewritten
    script file. There is a [Call] button in the dlg to help you locate any such
    files. The default extension is "*.pe" (postscript edit) but you can change
    that with the [Filter] button if you use something else.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="ScriptMenu">Script Menu</A>
  <DD>
    Only in the font view. You may define up to 10
    <A HREF="scripting.html#menu">scripts</A> that you want to execute frequently
    and place them in this menu. The scripts may also be invoked by short cut
    with the first one being invoked by Control-Meta(Alt)-1, the second
    Control-Meta-2, and the tenth by Control-Meta-0. The scripts are set in the
    <A HREF="prefs.html#scripts">preferences dialog</A>
  <DT>
    <A NAME="prefs">Preferences...</A>
  <DD>
    This pops up a <A HREF="prefs.html">dialog allowing you to configure various
    esoteric bits of pfaedit</A>.
    <P>
    A number of things that might be controlled from a preference window are
    controlled by <A HREF="xres.html">X Resources</A>.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Quit">Quit</A>
  <DD>
    Exits the program, prompting you whether to save any changed fonts.
