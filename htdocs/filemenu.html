  <DT>
    <A NAME="New">New</A>
  <DD>
    Creates a new font with ISO 8859-1 (Latin1) encoding.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Open">Open</A>
  <DD>
    Brings up a file chooser and allows you to open a font in any of the formats
    PfaEdit understands.
    <P>
    If you open a truetype font all character hinting (instructions) will be
    lost. If the truetype font contains bitmaps then you will be asked if you
    want to load some of the bitmaps as well as the outlines.
    <P>
    By default this dialog will display all files with extensions of pfa, pfb,
    sfd, ttf, otf and bdf. If you would also like it to display .ps files then
    enter *.{pfa,pfb,ttf,otf,bdf,sfd,ps} and press the Filter button. If you
    only want it to display sfd files enter *.sfd and press Filter.<BR>
    You may select multiple files (by holding down the shift or control keys
    when clicking on them), and all selected files will be opened.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Recent">Recent</A>
  <DD>
    A submenu showing recently used sfd files.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Close">Close</A>
  <DD>
    Closes the current window.
    <P>
    If this is a font view and the font has been changed, then it will ask whether
    you want to save the font. It will also close any outline character, bitmap
    character or metrics views associated with the font.
  <DT>
    Open <A NAME="Outline">Outline</A>
  <DD>
    In the font view this will open outline views on all selected characters
    (if there are more than 15 or so it will ask whether you really meant to
    do that).
    <P>
    In the bitmap view it will open an outline view on the current character.
    <P>
    In the metrics view it will open an outline view on whatever character is
    active.
    <P>
    This menu item is always grey in an outline view.
    <P>
    Note: It is possible to have more than one window displaying the same character.
    Any editing that occurs in one should be reflected in all.
  <DT>
    Open <A NAME="Bitmap">Bitmap</A>
  <DD>
    In the font view this will open bitmap views on all selected characters (if
    there are more than 15 or so it will ask whether you really meant to do that).
    If the font view is displaying a bitmap then it will open a bitmap view showing
    that pixelsize, otherwise it will pick a pixelsize.
    <P>
    In the outline view it will open a bitmap view on the current character.
    It will pick a pointsize.
    <P>
    In the metrics view it will open an outline view on whatever character is
    active, as with the font view, if it is displaying a bitmap it will use its
    pixelsize, otherwise it will pick a pixelsize.
    <P>
    This menu item is always grey in an bitmap view.
    <P>
    Note: It is possible to have more than one window displaying the same character.
    Any editing that occurs in one should be reflected in all.
  <DT>
    Open <A NAME="Metrics">Metrics</A>
  <DD>
    In the font view it will open a metrics view displaying all selected characters.
    The new metrics view will display whatever the font view displays (outline
    or bitmap).
    <P>
    In the outline view it will open a metrics view displaying the current character.
    The display will be an outline.
    <P>
    In the bitmap view it will open a metrics view displaying the current character.
    The display will be a bitmap in the current size.
    <P>
    This menu item is always grey in the metrics view.
    <P>
    It is possible to have more than one metrics view open at a time.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Save">Save</A>
  <DD>
    Saves the current file. If it is associated with a spline font database it
    will be saved there and a backup file will be created. If it is a new font,
    or if the font has been read from a postscript font file, then a Save As
    dialog will pop up.
    <P>
    If you are editing a font "Ambrosia.sfd" then the backup file will be called
    "Ambrosia~.sfd".
  <DT>
    <A NAME="SaveAs">Save</A> As...
  <DD>
    Allows you to give a new name to the current spline font database. Pops up
    a file picker.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Generate">Generate</A> Fonts...
  <DD>
    This generates font files, both outline and bitmap. You may choose not to
    generate either, you may generate an afm file or a pfm file, you may select
    the type of postscript output, you may select which pixelsizes of bitmap
    to generate.
    <P>
    The outline types are:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	PostScript Type1 font, binary format (a .pfb file, this may be used by adobe
	type manager or by the new x font server)
      <LI>
	PostScript Type1 font, ascii format (a .pfa file, this is used by printers)
      <LI>
	PostScript Type3 font (a .ps font, this is also used by printers and is not
	encrypted)
      <LI>
	PostScript Type0 font, this is only available if you have a font encoded
	with Unicode or one of the CJK encodings. Type0 fonts can have up to 65536
	characters in them (as opposed to 256 for Type1s and Type3s).
      <LI>
	PostScript CID font, this is only available if your font is a
	<A HREF="cidmenu.html">CID font</A>. This produces a font in the old Type1
	CID format. You probably want to use the OpenType CID format...
      <LI>
	True Type. The instructions (hinting) are probably not very good. No diagonal
	stems are hinted. Instructing is based on the hints used for postscript,
	with some additional work done for serifs, and some recognition that all
	characters of approximately the same height should have the same height at
	small pointsizes (equivalent to PostScript's BlueValues).
      <LI>
	True Type Symbol. Same as True Type, except it uses a symbol encoding scheme.
      <LI>
	Open Type. Officially Open Type includes True Type, but Open Type True Type
	fonts are no different from plain True Type fonts, so they might as well
	just be called True Type. So by Open Type I mean Open Type with a CFF Postscript
	Type 2 font inside it.
      <LI>
	Open Type CID, This is only available if your font is a
	<A HREF="cidmenu.html">CID font</A>. It procudes an OpenType CID-keyed font.
      <LI>
	None
    </UL>
    <P>
    The bitmap types are:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	BDF -- The internal bitmap fonts will be saved in bdf format. You may only
	select sizes for which you have already generated fonts
      <LI>
	GDF -- Greymap Distribution Format, used for saving anti-aliased fonts. The
	format is exactly the same as BDF except for one extra header "BITSPERPIXEL"
	which may have a value of 2, 4 or 8. You may pick any size you like (within
	reason), and an anti-aliased font will be generated for that size. As far
	as I know this is a totally useless format since I just created it, but I
	thought it a kind of neat idea.
      <LI>
	None
    </UL>
    <P>
    TTF (and Open Type) fonts are usually generated in MicroSoft's Unicode encoding,
    there will also be a tiny macintosh encoding for the first 256 positions
    -- the exceptions are: symbol fonts will use the symbol encoding, KSC5601
    fonts will use Wansung, and JIS208 will use SJIS. OpenType CID keyed fonts
    will be saved with Unicode encoding.<BR>
    Postscript fonts are generated in whatever encoding the font is using (expect
    you take a two byte encoding and generate a Type1 font (rather than a Type0)
    then only the first few characters will be encoded).<BR>
    PS CID and OpenType CID are saved with no encoding. The encodings live in
    seperate cmap files which are available from
    <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/acrrasianfontpack.html">adobe</A>
    (and perhaps other font vendors).<BR>
    If you save a CID font with a format other than PS CID or OpenType CID, then
    only the currenly displayed subfont will be saved, with the current meaningless
    character ordering (I suppose this is useful if you wish to extract a sub-font
    from a CID font).
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Revert">Revert</A>
  <DD>
    Rereads the font from the file on the disk. All changes are lost.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Export">Export</A>...
  <DD>
    In the Outline view this allows you to export the splines that make up the
    character into an encapsulated postscript (.eps) file or a file in xfig format
    (.fig -- the conversion to fig format is not the best). You may also have
    the character rasterized and output in either .xbm or .bmp formats (PfaEdit
    will prompt you for a pixelsize. bmp also allows you to generate an anti-aliased
    image, and you will be prompted for bits per pixel. 1 bit per pixel is a
    bitmap).
    <P>
    In the Bitmap view this allows you to export the current character as either
    a .xbm or a .bmp (always as a bitmap) file.
    <P>
    This menu item is not available in the Font or Metrics Views.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Import">Import</A>...
  <DD>
    In the Font View this allows you to import one or several bitmap fonts (from
    a .bdf file or a ttf/otf/ttc file, or a TeX pk file) and merge it into the
    list of bitmap sizes stored in the database. You may also load one bitmap
    font into the backgrounds of the outline characters (So "A" from the bitmap
    font goes into the background of the "A" outline character), this is to make
    tracing characters easier. Be careful, you need to load a big bitmap for
    autotrace to be useful. <FONT COLOR="Red"><SMALL><STRONG>NOTE:
    </STRONG></SMALL></FONT>PfaEdit is unable to read an encoding from pk files,
    it is your responsibility to ensure that the encoding of your font matches
    that of the pk file <EM>BEFORE</EM> loading the file. This is unfortunate,
    sorry.
    <P>
    In the Outline View this allows you to import an image into the background,
    or import encapsulated postscript or fig files into the foreground (the xfig
    conversion is really bad).
    <P>
    In the Bitmap View this allows you to import a bitmap image into the character.
    <P>
    This menu item is not available in the Metrics View<BR>
    &nbsp; <BR>
    In the font view you may select multiple files (by holding down the shift
    or control keys when clicking on them), and all selected bitmap fonts will
    be imported into the sfd.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Merge-kern">Merge Kern Info...</A>
  <DD>
    Only available in the font view window. This command will allow you to search
    for an afm (or tfm) file containing kerning pairs for the specified font.
    In many cases it will not be needed because when PfaEdit opens a .pfa or
    .pfb font it will automagically search for an appropriate .afm file in the
    same place. But sometimes afm files are stored in other directories. And
    sometimes you want to import information from TeX.<BR>
    <FONT COLOR="Red"><SMALL><STRONG>NOTE: </STRONG></SMALL></FONT>PfaEdit is
    unable to read an encoding from tfm files, it is your responsibility to ensure
    that the encoding of your font matches that of the tfm file <EM>BEFORE</EM>
    merging kerning information. This is unfortunate, sorry.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Print">Print</A>...
  <DD>
    Not available in the bitmap view. Allows you to print out all the characters
    in the font, a text sample of the font, or specific characters at a very
    large scale.<BR>
    See the section on <A HREF="print.html">printing</A> for more information.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="prefs">Preferences...</A>
  <DD>
    This pops up a dialog which allows you to specify
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Whether you want the widths of accented characters to track the width of
	the base character (so if you modify the width of A then the width of &Agrave;
	will automagically change, if &Agrave; is built as a reference to A and a
	reference to grave)
      <LI>
	Whether you want left side bearings of accented characters to track the left
	side bearing of base characters (so if you shift A left, then the accent
	in &Agrave; will also be shifted left)
      <LI>
	Whether characters should be automagically hinted before a bitmap character
	is generated (improves the quality of the bitmap)
      <LI>
	The default encoding used to create new fonts. Normally this is ISO 8859-1.
      <LI>
	The default encoding used by the operating system (ie. text that is pasted
	into pfaedit will be assumed to be in this encoding).
      <LI>
	The "Foundry Name". Used in generating bdf files (part of the X Windows font
	naming convention).
      <LI>
	The base
	"<A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/type/uniqueid.html">XUID</A>".
	Should uniquely identify the user's organization. If present then every new
	font will be given an XUID generated by appending a random number to the
	end of this string (which should consist of a set of numbers separated by
	spaces). Whenever a postscript font is generated then this last number will
	be incremented by 1.
    </UL>
    <P>
    A number of things that might be controlled from a preference window are
    controlled by <A HREF="xres.html">X Resources</A>.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Quit">Quit</A>
  <DD>
    Exits the program, prompting you whether to save any changed fonts.
