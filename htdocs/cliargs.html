  Command Line Arguments
</H1>
<P>
<CODE>$ pfaedit [-options] [filenames]<BR>
$ pfaedit [-script] scriptfile [arguments]</CODE>
<P>
The filenames may specify any number of files in one of the font formats
that PfaEdit recognizes (various postscript formats, truetype, opentype,
mac resource, bitmap).
<P>
Some files (.ttc or mac resource) may contain more than one outline font.
You may pick which font you want by following the filename with the fontname
in parentheses, thus:<BR>
<CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; $ pfaedit "gulim.ttc(GulimChe)"</CODE><BR>
will select the font GulimChe out of the font file gulim.ttc.
<P>
PfaEdit recognizes the following options:
<DL>
  <DT>
    -cmap type
  <DD>
    Where type may be<BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Current | Copy | Private<BR>
    Gives the user some control over <A HREF="xres.html#Colormap">colormap handling
    </A>on 8bit screens.
  <DT>
    -depth val
  <DD>
    Specifies that PfaEdit should search for a visual with the given depth
  <DT>
    -display name
  <DD>
    Specifies the name of the display on which PfaEdit will open its windows
  <DT>
    -help
  <DD>
    Bring up a <A HREF="helpmenu.html">browser</A> looking at this documentation.
  <DT>
    -version
  <DD>
    Prints out the source version and exits.
  <DT>
    -keyboard type
  <DD>
    Where type may be<BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; ibm | mac | sun | ppc | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3<BR>
    Allows you to specify the type of keyboard. Currently this is only relevent
    when generating menus. The modifier keys are in different locations on different
    keyboards (under different operating systems) and if PfaEdit knows what keyboard
    you are using it can make the hot-keys have better labels.
    <UL>
      <LI>
	ibm | 0<BR>
	Uses the Control and Alt keys
      <LI>
	mac | 1<BR>
	Uses the Command and Option keys (Mac OS/X, Mac keyboard)
      <LI>
	ppc | 3<BR>
	Uses the Control and Command keys (Suse ppc linux, Mac keyboard)
      <LI>
	sun | 2<BR>
	Uses the Control and Meta keys
    </UL>
  <DT>
    -new
  <DD>
    Creates a new font.
  <DT>
    -nosplash
  <DD>
    PfaEdit will not display its splash screen on startup (for slow connections)
  <DT>
    -recover type
  <DD>
    Where type may be:
    <DL>
      <DT>
	none
      <DD>
	Do not attempt any automatic file recovery
      <DT>
	clean
      <DD>
	Clean out the directory containing files to be recovered
      <DT>
	auto
      <DD>
	recover any files which have been changed but which pfaedit crashed on before
	saving.
    </DL>
  <DT>
    -script script-file
  <DD>
    If PfaEdit's first argument is "-script" then the argument that follows will
    be treated as a <A HREF="scripting.html">script file</A> and all the remaining
    arguments will be passed as arguments to that file. (The "-script" argument
    may be omitted, and if the first argument is an executable file which whose
    first line starts with "#!" and contains "pfaedit". This means that pfaedit
    may be used as an interpretter. Ie. you can create a pfaedit script file
    and type its name to your shell and pfaedit will be invoked to process that
    file as a script file (passing any arguments to it)).
  <DT>
    -sync
  <DD>
    Do synchronous screen drawing. Slows things down, makes some things easier
    to debug.

    (See the X manuals for a description of what these mean). PfaEdit will search
    through the visuals in an attempt to find one with the desired VisualClass
    (given here) and depth (given with the -depth option).

<DL>
  <DT>
    <CODE><A NAME="BROWSER">BROWSER</A></CODE>
  <DD>
    Specifies the name of a browser program for examining documentation (must
    be able to read a local or remote html file and display it reasonably). On
    CygWin systems browsers that work in the windows world (as opposed to the
    cygwin sub-system) must be specified by a full path spec.
  <DT>
    <CODE>AUTOTRACE</CODE>
  <DD>
    Specifies the name and location of the autotrace program. (if not specified
    PfaEdit will try to find it in the user's path)
  <DT>

    PfaEdit will try to find it in the user's path)

  <DT>
    <CODE>HOME</CODE>
  <DD>
    Used to figure out where to put the .PfaEdit directory which includes user
    preferences and the recovery files.
  <DT>
    <CODE>USER</CODE>
