  Command Line Arguments
</H1>
<P>
<CODE>$ pfaedit [-options] [filenames]</CODE>
<P>
The filenames may specify any number of files in one of the font formats
that PfaEdit recognizes (various postscript formats, truetype, opentype,
mac resource, bitmap).
<P>
Some files (.ttc or mac resource) may contain more than one outline font.
You may pick which font you want by following the filename with the fontname
in parentheses, thus:<BR>
<CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; $ pfaedit "gulim.ttc(GulimChe)"</CODE><BR>
will select the font GulimChe out of the font file gulim.ttc.
<P>
PfaEdit recognizes the following options:
<DL>
  <DT>
    -depth val
  <DD>
    Specifies that PfaEdit should search for a visual with the given depth
  <DT>
    -display name
  <DD>
    Specifies the name of the display on which PfaEdit will open its windows
  <DT>
    -help
  <DD>
    Bring up a <A HREF="helpmenu.html">browser</A> looking at this documentation.
  <DT>
    -keyboard type
  <DD>
    Where type may be<BR>
    ibm | mac | sun | ppc | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3<BR>
    Allows you to specify the type of keyboard. Currently this is only relevent
    when generating menus. The modifier keys are in different locations on different
    keyboards (under different operating systems) and if PfaEdit knows what keyboard
    you are using it can make the hot-keys have better labels.
