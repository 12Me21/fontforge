  Standard Transformations on Fonts
</H1>
<H3>
  Bold
</H3>
<P>
Bold fonts have thicker stems and are slightly more extended than normal
fonts. In Knuth's Computers &amp; Typesetting, the bold fonts have a stem
width that is approximately 1.6 (1.68(at 12pt)-1.5(at 5pt)) times the stem
width of the normal font. This is very similar to the 1.75 suggested by
Microsoft's ratio of 700/400 (700 being the numeric weight of a bold font,
and 400 being the numeric weight of a normal font).
<P>
In Knuth's Computer Modern Bold Extended Roman, the "m" character is extended
to 1.15 times the width of the "m" in Computer Modern Roman, and the x-height
is 1.03 times higher.
<H3>
  Point Size
</H3>
<P>
Traditionally, as the point-size decreases the boldness (thickness of the
stems) increases slightly. Most computer vector fonts do not show this change.
In Knuth's Computer Modern fonts:

  Italic
</H3>
<P>
The Italic transformation contains at least three parts: A change in the
letterforms of the lowercase letters, a skew, and a condensation. In Knuth's
Computer Modern Text Italic, the condensation is about .91. The glyphs are
skewed by 14&#186;.
<P>
<IMG SRC="ItalicComp.png" WIDTH="368" HEIGHT="48"> <SMALL>(These glyphs have
been deskewed to display the shape transformation better.)</SMALL>
<P>
This is not a complete list, but it shows most of the salient features of
such a transformation. The "g" character will often have a different shape
as well.
<H3>
  Oblique
</H3>
<P>
The Oblique transformation is a simple skew, in Computer Modern Slanted Sans
Serif it is 9.5&#186;.
<H3>
  Extended/Condensed
</H3>
<P>
In these two transformations the stem width is held constant but the horizontal
counter sizes and side bearings are increased (or decreased for condensed).
<H3>
  Modern/Old Style
</H3>
<P>
In Old Style fonts numerals tended to be lower-case, the x-height tended
to be less than half the ascent, and the cap-height tended to be visibly
smaller than the ascent.
