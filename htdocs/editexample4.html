  <A NAME="accents">Building</A> accented characters
</H2>
<P>
Latin, Greek and Cyrillic all have a large complement of accented characters.
PfaEdit provides several ways to build accented characters out of base
characters.
<P>
The most obvious mechanism is simple copy and paste:
<A HREF="editmenu.html#Copy">Copy</A> the letter "A" and
<A HREF="editmenu.html#Paste">Paste</A> it to "&Atilde;" then
<A HREF="editmenu.html#Copy">copy</A> the tilde accent and
<A HREF="editmenu.html#PasteInto">Paste it Into</A> "&Atilde;" (note Paste
Into is subtly different from Paste. Paste clears out the character before
pasting, while Paste Into merges what was in the character with the what
is in the clipboard). Then you open up "&Atilde;" and position the accent
so that it appears properly centered over the A.
<P>
This mechanism is not particularly efficient, if you change the shape of
the letter "A" you will need to regenerate all the accented characters built
from it. PfaEdit has the concept of a
<A HREF="overview.html#References">Reference</A> to a character. So you can
Copy a Reference to "A", and Paste it, the Copy a Reference to tilde and
Paste it Into, and then again adjust the position of the accent over the
A.
<P>
Then if you change the shape of the A the shape of the A in "&Atilde;" will
be updated automagically -- as will the width of "&Atilde;".
<P>
But PfaEdit knows that "&Atilde;" is built out of "A" and the tilde accent,
and it can easily create your accented characters itself by placing the
references in "&Atilde;" and then positioning the accent over the "A". (Unicode
provides a database which lists the components of every accented character
(in Unicode)).
<P>
As an example, open the file: tutorial/Ambrosia.sfd, then select all the
characters at encodings 0xc0-0xff, and then press
<A HREF="elementmenu.html#Accented">Element-&gt;Build-&gt;Build Accented</A>
all the accented characters will magically appear (there are a few characters
in this range which are not accented, and they will remain blank).
<P>
PfaEdit has a heuristic for positioning accents (most accents are centered
over the highest point of the character), sometimes this will produce bad
results (if the one of the two stems of "u" is slightly taller than the other
the accent will be placed over it rather than centered over the character),
so you should be prepared to look at your accented characters after creating
them. You may need to adjust one or two (or you may need to redesign your
base characters slightly).
<H2>
  <A NAME="ligature">Creating</A> a ligature
</H2>
<P>
Unicode contains a number of ligature characters (in latin we have: &AElig;,
OE, fi, etc. while in arabic there are hundreds). Again Unicode provides
a database listing the components of each standard ligature.
<P>
PfaEdit cannot create a nice ligature for you, but what it can do is put
all the components of the ligature into the character with
<A HREF="elementmenu.html#Accented">Element-&gt;Build-&gt;Build Composite</A>.
This makes it slightly easier (at least in latin) to design a ligature.
<P>
There are a good many ligatures needed for the indic scripts, but Unicode
does not provide an encoding for them. If you wish to build a ligature that
is not part of Unicode you may do so. First <A HREF="faq.html#new-name">add
an unencoded character to your font</A> (or if your font is a Unicode font,
use a code point in the private use area), and name the character. The name
is important, if you name it correctly PfaEdit will be able to figure out
that it is a ligature and what its componants are. If you want to build a
ligature out of the characters "longs", "longs" and "l" then name it
"longs_longs_l", if you want to build a ligature out of Unicode 0D15, 0D4D
and 0D15 then name it "uni0D15_uni0D4D_uni0D15".
<P>
Once you have named your ligature, and inserted its components (with Build
Composite), you probably want to open the character,
<A HREF="editmenu.html#Unlink">Unlink your References</A> and edit them to
make a pleasing shape.
<P>
<IMG SRC="charinfo-akhn.png" WIDTH="307" HEIGHT="401" ALT="Char Info for Akhand ligature type"
    ALIGN="Right">Finally you should check that PfaEdit has marked your character
as a ligature (and, if so, as the right kind of ligature). Bring up the
<A HREF="charinfo.html#ligature">Element-&gt;Char Info-&gt;Ligature</A> dialog.
You should see a line like:<BR>
<TT>&nbsp; &nbsp; liga &nbsp;m longs longs l</TT><BR>
or <BR>
<TT>&nbsp; &nbsp; liga &nbsp;m uni0D15 uni0D4D uni0D15</TT><BR>
In the first case you might want to add an additional line (by pressing the
[New...] button:<BR>
<TT>&nbsp; &nbsp; liga &nbsp;m longs_longs l</TT><BR>
(assuming you have a longs_longs ligature already). While in the second case
you might want to select the line, press the [Edit...] button and change
the ligature type from 'liga' to 'akhn' (I don't know enough about Indic
scripts to understand this distinction myself), yielding: <BR>
<TT>&nbsp; &nbsp; akhn &nbsp;m uni0D15 uni0D4D uni0D15</TT>
