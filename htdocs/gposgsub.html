  <TITLE>The GPOS and GSUB opentype tables</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1 ALIGN=Center>
The <B><CODE>GPOS</CODE></B> and <B><CODE>GSUB</CODE></B> opentype tables
</H1>
<P>
These two tables are used for positioning and substituting glyphs. The GPOS
table can control things like: kerning, accent positioning, cursive joining,
etc. The GSUB table can control things like: ligatures, arabic forms, vertical
rotation, conversion to small caps, indic glyph rearangment, etc.
<P>
PfaEdit does not support the full range of possibilities inherent in these two
tables.
<H2>
The <B><CODE>GPOS</CODE></B> table
</H2>
<P>
PfaEdit will read the following sub tables of the GPOS table:
<TABLE Border=1>
<TR>
<TD>
<CODE>'kern'</CODE>
</TD><TD>
The kerning sub-table
</TD><TD>
PfaEdit will read kerning information from the GPOS table, also from afm and tfm files
and macintoy FOND resources. Users can create and modify kerning with the
<A HREF="metricsview.html">metrics view.</A>
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<CODE>'mark'</CODE>
</TD><TD>
Mark Positioning
</TD><TD>
PfaEdit will read anchor points from the GPOS table. I am not aware of any
way to provide this information with type1 fonts.
Users can create and modify anchor points in the
<A HREF="charview.html">character view.</A>
<HR>
There are several different tables which specify anchor points which
position other characters with respect to the current one.
For a description of anchor points
<A HREF="overview.html#Anchors>see the overview.</A>
<P>This table is used for positioning marks (diacritic marks) around letters.
</TD></TR>

<CODE>'abvm'</CODE>
</TD><TD>
Above Baseline Mark Positioning
</TD><TD>
PfaEdit will read anchor points from the GPOS table. I do not know how this
sub-table's semantics differ from those of the 'mark' table (the opentype
docs say this has something to do with indic languages, but don't describe
why 'mark' is inadiquate). PfaEdit treats this just like 'mark'.
Users can create and modify anchor points in the
<A HREF="charview.html">character view.</A>

Mark to Mark Positioning
</TD><TD>
PfaEdit will read anchor points from the GPOS table.
Users can create and modify anchor points in the
<A HREF="charview.html">character view.</A>
<P>This table is used for positioning marks (diacritic marks) around other
diacritic marks.
</TD>
</TABLE>
<P>
PfaEdit is also able to create a GPOS table with all the above sub-tables.
<H2>
The <B><CODE>GSUB</CODE></B> table
</H2>
<P>
PfaEdit will read the following sub tables of the GSUB table:
<TABLE Border=1>
<TR>
<TD>
<CODE>'liga'</CODE>
</TD><TD>
The standard ligature sub-table.
</TD><TD>
PfaEdit will read ligature information from the GPOS table, also from afm and tfm files.
Users can create and modify ligatures with the
<A HREF="charinfo.html">character information dialog.</A>
<HR>
There are several different tables which specify ligature data. The different
tables classify ligatures into groups as:
<UL>
<LI>Required ligatures must always be applied
<LI>Standard ligatures should be applied
<LI>Discretionary ligatures may be applied
<LI>Historic ligatures were common at one point but have fallen out of use and
in most cases should not be applied.
<LI>Fractions will take the string "3/4" and replace it with "¾"
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<CODE>'rlig'</CODE>
</TD><TD>
The required ligature sub-table.
</TD><TD>
PfaEdit will read ligature information from the GPOS table, also from afm and tfm files.
Users can create and modify ligatures with the
<A HREF="charinfo.html">character information dialog.</A>
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<CODE>'dlig'</CODE>
</TD><TD>
The discretionary ligature sub-table.
</TD><TD>
PfaEdit will read ligature information from the GPOS table, also from afm and tfm files.
Users can create and modify ligatures with the
<A HREF="charinfo.html">character information dialog.</A>
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<CODE>'hlig'</CODE>
</TD><TD>
The historic ligature sub-table.
</TD><TD>
PfaEdit will read ligature information from the GPOS table, also from afm and tfm files.
Users can create and modify ligatures with the
<A HREF="charinfo.html">character information dialog.</A>
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<CODE>'frac'</CODE>
</TD><TD>
The fraction ligature sub-table.
</TD><TD>
PfaEdit will read ligature information from the GPOS table, also from afm and tfm files.
Users can create and modify ligatures with the
<A HREF="charinfo.html">character information dialog.</A>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
PfaEdit can write all the above subtables of GSUB, and it may also write
<TABLE Border=1>
<TR>
<TD>
<CODE>'vrt2'</CODE>
</TD><TD>
The vertical alternates and rotation sub-table
</TD><TD>
This is used when Japanese or Chinese or Korean
writing is displayed vertically. Some characters have different varients
depending on the writing direction (parentheses for instance), also roman text should be
rotated. PfaEdit gathers the information for this table from the names of the
characters in the font. If a character is named "vertuniXXXX" then it is assumed
to be the vertical varient of "uniXXXX", or if a character is named "vertcid_nnn"
it is assumed to be the vertical varient of CID nnn.

<CODE>'init'</CODE>
</TD><TD>
The initial forms sub-table
</TD><TD>
PfaEdit will generate this if the font contains arabic characters in the
ranges U+0600-U+06ff and U+FB00-UFEFF. This will map each non-formed arabic
character (the one in the U+0600 area) to its initial form varient (>U+FB00).
<HR>
In renaissance writing this sub-table might be used to map short-s to long.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<CODE>'medi'</CODE>
</TD><TD>
The medial forms sub-table
</TD><TD>
PfaEdit will generate this if the font contains arabic characters in the
ranges U+0600-U+06ff and U+FB00-UFEFF. This will map each non-formed arabic
character (the one in the U+0600 area) to its medial form varient (>U+FB00).
<HR>
In renaissance writing this sub-table might be used to map short-s to long.
</TD></TR>

<CODE>'fina'</CODE>
</TD><TD>
The final forms sub-table
</TD><TD>
PfaEdit will generate this if the font contains arabic characters in the
ranges U+0600-U+06ff and U+FB00-UFEFF. This will map each non-formed arabic
character (the one in the U+0600 area) to its final form varient (>U+FB00).
<HR>
In renaissance writing this sub-table might be used to map long-s to short.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<CODE>'isol'</CODE>
</TD><TD>
The isolated forms sub-table
</TD><TD>
PfaEdit will generate this if the font contains arabic characters in the
ranges U+0600-U+06ff and U+FB00-UFEFF. This will map each non-formed arabic
character (the one in the U+0600 area) to its isolated form varient (>U+FB00).
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<CODE>'smcp'</CODE>
</TD><TD>
The Small Capitals sub-table
</TD><TD>
PfaEdit will generate this if the font contains glyphs with names that end in
".sc" or ".oldstyle". It provides a mapping between "a" and "a.sc" (or between
"zero" and "zero.oldstyle". I cannot fathom why Adobe had decided that oldstyle is similar to
small caps, but they say that's what this table does.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<CODE>'c2sc'</CODE>
</TD><TD>
The Small Capitals from capitals sub-table
</TD><TD>
PfaEdit will generate this if the font contains glyphs with names that end in

</TD><TD>
The required ligature sub-table.
