  Advanced Typography Tables
</H1>
<P>
These differ between OpenType (originally called TrueType Open) and Apple
(GX or Apple Advanced Typography). My support for Apple is minimal as yet.
My support for OpenType is not complete.

  <LI>

  The <B><CODE>GPOS,</CODE></B> <B><CODE>GSUB</CODE></B> and
  <B><CODE>GDEF</CODE></B> <A NAME="opentype">opentype</A> tables
</H2>
<P>
These two tables are used for positioning and substituting glyphs. The GPOS
table can control things like: kerning, accent positioning, cursive joining,
etc. The GSUB table can control things like: ligatures, arabic forms, vertical
rotation, conversion to small caps, indic glyph rearrangement, etc.
<P>
This page assumes basic familiarity with the abilities of the tables, for
more information on them read, study and inwardly digest the opentype docs
on:

<P>
The basic idea of the GPOS and GSUB tables is that each script (or language
within a script) has a set of "features" that are available to it. A feature
in turn is associated with a lookup which contains data for the feature.
An example of a script is 'latn' for latin, 'arab' for arabic, 'hani' for
chinese ideographs. Two examples of features are 'kern' which provides kerning
information between pairs of glyphs and 'init' which will transform one set
of glyphs to another when those glyphs are at the beginning of a word.
<P>
PfaEdit <A HREF="gposgsub.html#Unsupported">does not support </A>the full
range of possibilities inherent in these tables.
<H3>
  The <B><CODE><A NAME="GPOS">GPOS</A></CODE></B> table
</H3>
<P>
PfaEdit will read the following sub tables of the GPOS table:
<TABLE Border=1>
  <TR>
    <TH></TH>
    <TH>name</TH>
    <TH>Reading support</TH>
    <TH>Writing support</TH>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>1</TD>
    <TD>single adjustment</TD>
    <TD>This sub-table allows the font designer to change the metrics of a specific
      character. The feature tag will provide a context in which the change should
      occur. For instance the 'tnum' (tabular numbers) feature could change a
      proportionally spaced digit by adjusting its advance width to be some set
      value and then centering the digit (by adjusting the left side bearing) within
      the new width.</TD>
    <TD>These can be created with the <A HREF="charinfo.html">Element-&gt;Char
      Info</A>-&gt;Position command.</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>2</TD>
    <TD>pair adjustment</TD>
    <TD>This sub-table allows the font designer to change the metrics of a specific
      pair of character. The most common use of this is for kerning where the advance
      width of the first character is altered depending on which character follows
      it. But the table is more general than that and could support mark (accent,
      vowel) positioning over a base character (though that is more efficiently
      done with the mark to base subtable).</TD>
    <TD>'kern' feature s may be created from the <A HREF="metricsview.html">Metrics
      View</A>. 'vkrn' with
      <A HREF="metricsmenu.html#VKernFromHKern">Metrics-&gt;VKern From HKern</A>.</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>3</TD>
    <TD>cursive attachment</TD>
    <TD>This sub-table allows the font designer to force adjacent characters
      to join at specific points. It can be used to generate the slanted script
      style needed for Urdu.</TD>
    <TD>Only the 'curs' feature is supported for this sub-table. These may be
      created with the <A HREF="pointmenu.html#AddAnchor">Points-&gt;Add Anchor</A>
      command</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>4</TD>
    <TD>mark to base</TD>
    <TD>This sub-table allows the font designer to specify how mark characters
      (accents, vowel signs, etc.) are positioned over base characters. Every character
      can have an attachment point and the mark's attachment point will be placed
      on the base's attachment point so the two join properly. See my
      <A HREF="overview.html#Anchors">example</A> in the overview.</TD>
    <TD>These may be created with the
      <A HREF="pointmenu.html#AddAnchor">Points-&gt;Add Anchor</A> command</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>5</TD>
    <TD>mark to ligature</TD>
    <TD>This sub-table is very similar to the previous one except that the base
      character is a ligature and may have several different points at which the
      same type of accent may be placed.</TD>
    <TD>These may be created with the
      <A HREF="pointmenu.html#AddAnchor">Points-&gt;Add Anchor</A> command</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>6</TD>
    <TD>mark to mark</TD>
    <TD>This sub-table is very similar to the previous two except that the base
      character is itself a mark. This may be used when a character has two accents
      each of which would normally be placed at the same attachment point on a
      base character. The second accent will be place relative to the first accent
      rather than to the base character.</TD>
    <TD>These may be created with the
      <A HREF="pointmenu.html#AddAnchor">Points-&gt;Add Anchor</A> command</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>7</TD>
    <TD>contextual positioning</TD>
    <TD>This sub-table allows the font designer to control the positioning of
      characters when they occur within a specific string (or class of strings).
      For instance this table could say "when you see a digit followed by the string
      "th" then raise the "th" into a superscript position"</TD>
    <TD>These may be created with the
      <A HREF="fontinfo.html#Contextual">Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;Contextual
      </A>command</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>8</TD>
    <TD>chaining contextual positioning</TD>
    <TD>This is a slightly more complex version of the above, it doesn't really
      add new capabilities, but it does provide a more logical approach to the
      issue.</TD>
    <TD>These may be created with the
      <A HREF="fontinfo.html#Contextual">Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;Contextual
      </A>command</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>9</TD>
    <TD>extension positioning</TD>
    <TD>This is used to allow for a GPOS table which is bigger than 64k. Its
      use should be quite invisible to the font designer</TD>
    <TD>PfaEdit uses this sub-table when needed.</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>

    <TD></TD>
    <TD>PfaEdit does not support these sub-tables yet.<BR>
      (nor does anyone)</TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
PfaEdit also has built into it knowledge on how to provide default values
for some features that use these tables. See
<A HREF="elementmenu.html#DefaultATT">Element-&gt;Default ATT</A> command
for that.
<P>
PfaEdit will retain the order of features in the GPOS table and when a font
is generated the order should be the same as it was before.
<H3>
  The <B><CODE><A NAME="GSUB">GSUB</A></CODE></B> table
</H3>
<P>
PfaEdit will read the following sub tables of the GSUB table:
<TABLE Border=1>
  <TR>
    <TH></TH>
    <TH>name</TH>
    <TH>Reading support</TH>
    <TH>Writing support</TH>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>1</TD>
    <TD>single substitution</TD>
    <TD>This sub-table allows the font designer to change from one glyph to another,
      with a context provided by the feature tag. For example many scripts have
      letters which have a different form at the end of a word than they do within
      (this is true of every letter in arabic, several in hebrew, lower case sigma
      in greek, and the long-s/short-s pair in renaissance latin). So the 'fina'
      feature would map the normal form into the final form, and the word processing
      program would do a lookup at the end of each word to see if a transformation
      was needed.</TD>
    <TD>These can be created with the <A HREF="charinfo.html">Element-&gt;Char
      Info</A>-&gt;Substitution command.</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>2</TD>
    <TD>multiple substitution</TD>
    <TD>This sub-table allows the font designer to replace one glyph by a series
      of others. This is generally used for rather technical layout issues.</TD>
    <TD>These can be created with the <A HREF="charinfo.html">Element-&gt;Char
      Info</A>-&gt;Multiple Substitution command.</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>3</TD>
    <TD>alternate substitution</TD>
    <TD>This sub-table allows the font designer to have a series of "alternates"
      for each glyph. One common example would be an italic font which had several
      swash variants for each capital letter. The word processing program would
      allow the user to choose which variant was appropriate</TD>
    <TD>These can be created with the <A HREF="charinfo.html">Element-&gt;Char
      Info</A>-&gt;Alternate Substitution command.</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>4</TD>
    <TD>ligature substitution</TD>
    <TD>This sub-table allows the font designer to replace a string of characters
      with another glyph. A common example is a ligature where the string
      <IMG SRC="f+i.png" WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="Middle"> is replaced by
      the <IMG SRC="fi.png" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="Middle"> ligature.</TD>
    <TD>These can be created with the <A HREF="charinfo.html">Element-&gt;Char
      Info</A>-&gt;Ligature command.</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>5</TD>
    <TD>contextual substitution</TD>
    <TD>This subtable allows for a string of glyphs to replace another string
      of glyphs (or class of strings of glyphs)</TD>
    <TD>These may be created with the
      <A HREF="fontinfo.html#Contextual">Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;Contextual

  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>8</TD>
    <TD>reverse chaining contextual single substitution</TD>
    <TD>This allows glyph substitutions to happen in reverse order, and it a
      varient of the chaining contextual subtable.</TD>
    <TD>These may be created with the
      <A HREF="fontinfo.html#Contextual">Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;Contextual

<P>
PfaEdit also has built into it knowledge on how to provide default values
for some features that use these tables. See
<A HREF="elementmenu.html#DefaultATT">Element-&gt;Default ATT</A> command
for that.
<P>
PfaEdit can produce some of these tables, but the text layout/word processing
program used has to look up the tables and do the actual work of rearranging
the glyphs.
<P>
PfaEdit will retain the order of features in the GSUB table, and the user
may adjust it with the <A HREF="fontinfo.html#Order">Element-&gt;Font Info</A>
command.
<H3>
  The <B><CODE><A NAME="GDEF">GDEF</A> </CODE></B>table
</H3>
<P>
PfaEdit will read ligature carets out of a GDEF table.
<P>
It will generate a GDEF table containing a glyph class definition sub-table
(if needed) or a ligature caret sub-table (if needed).

  Why do contextual substitutions only <A NAME="sometimes">sometimes</A> get
  generated in AAT?
</H3>
<P>
Sadly OpenType and AAT provide disjoint capabilities when it comes to contextual
positioning. AAT is more capable in some areas, OpenType more capable in
others. PfaEdit is able to convert an OpenType contextual substitution into
an AAT if PfaEdit can detect that the OpenType substitution does not use
capabilies beyond those of AAT. Currently this means:
<UL>
  <LI>
    There is an apple feature which matches the otf tag
  <LI>
    The sub-table is in coverage format
  <LI>
    The sub-table contains either exactly one nested single glyph replacement
    substitution, or<BR>
    it contains exactly two single glyph replacements and one of them refers
    to the last glyph matched (and the other does not)
</UL>
<P>
PfaEdit does not even try to parse an AAT contextual glyph substitution
sub-table, too few of these can be expressed in OpenType to make it worth
while.

</TABLE>
<P>
<A NAME="mine">*</A> Tags which are entirely in upper case have been added
by me. They do not correspond to any known opentype tag, and are used solely
for supporting macintoys. You may adjust this conversion table (by adding
your own tags for various mac feature/settings) from the
<A HREF="prefs.html#Mac">preference dialog</A>.
<P>
PfaEdit will retain the order of features in the morx table, and the user
may adjust it with the <A HREF="fontinfo.html#Order">Element-&gt;Font Info</A>
command. (this is the same list as that used for GSUB table. GSUB features
that don't correspond to mac features will be ignored).

<P>
PfaEdit does not (yet) support all the advanced typographic features available
in either opentype or apple advanced typography.

  Apple Advanced Typography
</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>
    PfaEdit only supports apple features if it has a mapping between that feature
    and an opentype feature tag. Use the
    <A HREF="prefs.html#Mac">File-&gt;Preference dialog</A> to extend PfaEdit's
    default mapping.
  <LI>
    PfaEdit does not support Indic rearrangement or contextual glyph insertion
    in 'mort'/'morx' tables.
  <LI>
    PfaEdit will generate (but not read) a contextual glyph substitution sub-table
    for the specific case of arabic forms, and for some specific contextual
    substitution opentype features.
  <LI>
    PfaEdit supports no other contextual glyph substitution sub-tables.
  <LI>
    PfaEdit will never generate a 'mort' table. It can read 'mort' tables, but
    it will only produce 'morx' tables.
