  <TITLE>The GPOS and GSUB opentype tables</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1 ALIGN=Center>
The <B><CODE>GPOS</CODE></B> and <B><CODE>GSUB</CODE></B> opentype tables
</H1>
<P>
These two tables are used for positioning and substituting glyphs. The GPOS
table can control things like: kerning, accent positioning, cursive joining,
etc. The GSUB table can control things like: ligatures, arabic forms, vertical
rotation, conversion to small caps, indic glyph rearangment, etc.
<P>
This page assumes basic familiarity with the abilities of the tables, for more
information on them read, study and inwardly digest the opentype docs on:

<P>
The basic idea of both these tables is that each script (or language within a script) has
a set of "features" that are available to it. A feature in turn is associated with
a lookup which contains data for the feature. An example of a script is 'latn' for
latin, 'arab' for arabic, 'hani' for chinese ideographs. Two examples of 
features are 'kern' which provides kerning information between pairs of glyphs
and 'init' which will transform one set of glyphs to another when those
glyphs are at the beginning of a word
<P>
PfaEdit does not support the full range of possibilities inherent in these two
tables.

The <B><CODE>GPOS</CODE></B> table

<P>
PfaEdit will read the following sub tables of the GPOS table:
<TABLE Border=1>
<TR>
<TD>1</TD>
<TD>single adjustment</TD>
<TD>These can be created with the <A HREF="charinfo.html">Element->Char Info</A>->Position command.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>2</TD>
<TD>pair adjustment</TD>
<TD>Only the 'kern' feature is supported for this sub-table. These may be
created from the <A HREF="metricsview.html">Metrics View</A></TD>

<TD>3</TD>
<TD>cursive attachment</TD>
<TD>Only the 'curs' feature is supported for this sub-table. These may be

PfaEdit also has built into it knowledge on how to provide default values for
some features that use these menus. See <A HREF="elementmenu.html#DefaultATT">Element->Default ATT</A>
command for that.
