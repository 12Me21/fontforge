  <A NAME="Special">Special </A>thoughts for special scripts
</H2>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/specs/default.htm">Microsoft</A>
provides some information on what features a word processor should support
by default for certain scripts.
<H3>
  Latin
</H3>
<P>
There are not many special complications in latin. Latin fonts can generally
fit in a single byte encoding with no (or few) font tables. There are a plethora
of accented characters which should be built. Kerning should be generated
for some character combinations. A few ligatures need to be generated (the
"f" ligatures: ff, fi, fl, ffi, ffl and perhaps st).
<P>
You may want to add a set of smallcaps. If you do, Adobe has reserved a block
in the private use area for latin small-caps.
<P>
Some languages have specific requirements of their own

</UL>
<H3>
  Greek
</H3>
<P>
Greek also does not have many complications. Modern Greek fonts generally
fit in a single byte encoding. There are a few accented characters that need
to be built. Kerning should be generated. I am not aware of any standard
ligatures for modern greek (ancient greek had ligatures and varients on some
of the characters though).
<P>
Small caps are again an option, and I have reserved a block in the private
use area for them.
<H3>
  Cyrillic
</H3>
<P>
Cyrillic fonts also fit in a single byte encoding. There are a few accented
characters. Kerning should be generated. I am not aware of any standard
ligatures.
<P>
I am not aware of any need for small caps (in most cyrillic fonts most lower
case letters are already small caps).
<P>
Again some languages need different glyphs

<H3>
  Arabic
</H3>
<P>
Arabic needs a complete set of initial, medial, final and isolated forms
-- Unicode has reserved space for these. Arabic also needs a vast set of
ligatures -- Unicode has reserved space for many, but I'd guess that extra
ligatures will be needed sometimes. Arabic also needs a set of mark (mark
to base, mark to ligature) attachments to position vowels above letters.
Arabic may need a character decomposition table.
<P>
I'm told that in good Arabic typography there need to be many more than 4
forms per glyph. I'm not sure how this should be supported.
<P>

<H3>
  Hebrew
</H3>
<P>
Hebrew has a few final forms but no special tables are needed for these.
Hebrew may need kerning. Hebrew should have a set of mark (mark to base)
tables to position vowels over letters. Hebrew may need a character decomposition
table. I am not aware of any needed ligatures.
<P>
Right to left
<H3>
  Indic scripts
</H3>
<P>
Indic scripts need a set of ligatures.
<P>
(they probably need a lot more but I'm not aware of what)
<H3>
  Korean Hangul
</H3>
<P>
The Hangul script consists of a set of syllables built out of a phonetic
alphabet. Generally fonts consist of a set of precomposed syllables.
<P>
Complications are introduced by the massive combinatorial explosion of all
these syllables. These are eased in postscript by CID-keyed fonts.
<P>
Vertical writing and left to right writing are used, and some characters
have a different orientation when drawn vertically (parentheses for example).
<H3>
  Japanese and Chinese (and Korean Hanja)
</H3>
<P>
Again a massive collection of glyphs is needed, and postscript uses CID keyed
fonts to deal with this.
<P>
Vertical writing and left to right writing are used, and some characters
have a different orientation when drawn vertically (parentheses for example).
