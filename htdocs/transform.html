<P>
This dialog is available in the font and outline views. In the font view
it applies to all selected characters. In the outline view if there is a
selection then it applies to that. if there is no selection then it applies
to the entire character.
<P>
You may choose whether you want the transformation to be centered at the
character's origin, the center of the selection (or of the character as a
whole if there is no selection), or the location of the last point on which
you clicked the mouse.
<P>
You may apply several different transformations at once:
<DL>
  <DT>
    Do Nothing
  <DD>
    A very simple transformation.
  <DT>
    Move
  <DD>
    You may more the selection an arbitrary amount in the x and y directions
  <DT>
    Rotate
  <DD>
    You may rotate the selection an arbitrary number of degrees.
  <DT>
    Scale
  <DD>
    You may scale the two coordinates differently
  <DT>
    Scale Uniformly
  <DD>
    You may scale the two coordinates the same amount.
  <DT>
    Flip
  <DD>
    You may flip either horizontally or vertically
  <DT>
    Skew
  <DD>
    You may skew the selection a certain number of degrees (to create an oblique
    font for example).
</DL>
<P>
If you are in the font view, and if <A HREF="editmenu.html#From">Copy From</A>
is set to all fonts, then the transformation will also be applied to the
bitmaps. Not all of these transforms can be mapped to ones on the bitmap
font (arbitrary rotations, scales, etc. do not map). Only rotations by 90
degrees, flips, skews and moves will be approximated on the bitmap characters.
<P>
Transformations in the Outline character view are not applied to any bitmaps.
(Nor are transformations in the bitmap window mapped back to the outline).
