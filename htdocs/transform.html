  Transform Dialog

<P>
This dialog is available in the font, outline and metrics views. In the font
view it applies to all selected characters. In the outline view if there
is a selection then it applies to that. if there is no selection then it
applies to the entire character.
<P>
You may choose whether you want the transformation to be centered at the
character's origin, the center of the selection (or of the character as a
whole if there is no selection), or the location of the last point on which
you clicked the mouse.
<P>
You may apply several different transformations at once:
<DL>
  <DT>
    Do Nothing
  <DD>
    A very simple transformation.
  <DT>
    Move
  <DD>
    You may move the selection an arbitrary amount in the x and y directions
  <DT>
    Rotate
  <DD>
    You may rotate the selection an arbitrary number of degrees.
  <DT>
    Scale
  <DD>
    You may scale the two coordinates differently
  <DT>
    Scale Uniformly
  <DD>
    You may scale the two coordinates the same amount (which can of course be
    done above, but it's slightly easier only to set one number).
  <DT>
    Flip
  <DD>
    You may flip either horizontally or vertically
  <DT>
    Skew
  <DD>
    You may skew the selection a certain number of degrees (to create an oblique
    font for example).
  <DT>
    Move by Ruler
  <DD>
    Fill in the amount to move from the x and y offsets of the last measurements
    made with the <A HREF="charview.html#Ruler">ruler tool</A>.
  <DT>
    Rotate by Ruler
  <DD>
    Fill in the rotation angle from the angle of the last measurements made with
    the <A HREF="charview.html#Ruler">ruler tool</A>.
  <DT>
    Move by Ruler
  <DD>
    Fill in the skew angle from the angle of the last measurements made with
    the <A HREF="charview.html#Ruler">ruler tool</A>.
</DL>
<P>
If you are in the font view, and if <A HREF="editmenu.html#From">Copy From</A>
is set to all fonts, then the transformation will also be applied to the
bitmaps. Not all of these transforms can be mapped to ones on the bitmap
font (arbitrary rotations, scales, etc. do not map). Only rotations by 90
degrees, flips, skews and moves will be approximated on the bitmap characters.
<P>
If you are in the font view, then any pair-wise kerning information whose
first character is selected will be scaled (but not translated) by the
transformation matrix. Similarly and simple positioning features that apply
to a selected character will be transformed by the matrix (but again not
translated). You may choose to
<P>
If you are in the font view or the outline view and there is no selection
(and you are in the foreground) there is a "[] Transform Background Too"
check box. If you check this then anything in the background will be transformed
with the foreground.
<P>
If you check [] Round to Int then after the transformation has been applied
everything will be rounded to an integer value.
<P>
Transformations in the Outline character view are not applied to any bitmaps.
(Nor are transformations in the bitmap window mapped back to the outline).
