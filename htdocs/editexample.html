If you wish to follow along with the tutorial, <A HREF="tutorial.tgz">this
bundle</A> should provide you with the basic files you need.

  <A NAME="FontCreate">Font creation</A>

<P>
First create a new font with the <CODE>New</CODE> command in the
<CODE>File</CODE> menu (or by using the <KBD>-new</KBD> argument at startup).
<P>
<IMG SRC="newfont.png" WIDTH="419" HEIGHT="189">
<P>
Give the font a name with the <CODE><A HREF="fontinfo.html">Font
Info</A></CODE> command from the <CODE>Element</CODE> menu. You use this
same command to change the encoding (ie what characters are available in
the font), set the copyright message and change the ascent and descent (the
sum of these two determines the size of the em square for the font, and by
convention is 1000 for postscript fonts, a power of two (often 2048 or 4096)
for truetype fonts and 15,000 for Ikarus fonts). <SMALL>(Also if you are
planning on making a truetype font you might want to check the Quadratic
Splines checkbox to use the native truetype format. Editing is a little more
difficult in this mode though)</SMALL>

Once you have done that you are ready to start editing characters. Double
click on the entry for "C" in the font view above. You should now have an
empty Outline Character window:
<P>
<IMG SRC="C1.png" WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="283">
<P>
The outline character window contains two palettes snuggled up on the left
side of the window. The top palette contains a set of editing tools, and
the bottom palette controls which layers of the window are visible or editable.
<P>
The foreground layer contains the outline that will become part of the font.
The background layer can contain images or line drawings that help you draw
this particular character. The guide layer contains lines that are useful
on a font-wide basis (such as the x-height). Currently all layers are empty.
<P>
This window also shows the character's internal coordinate system with the
x and y axes drawn in light grey. A line representing the character's advance
width is drawn in black at the right edge of the window. FontForge assigns
an advance width of one em (in PostScript that will usually be 1000 units)
to the advance width of a new character.
<P>
Select the Import command from the File menu and import an image of the character
you are creating. It will be scaled so that it is as high as the em-square.
<P>
<IMG SRC="C2.png" WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="283">
<P>
Select the background layer as editable from the layers palette, move the
mouse pointer to one of the edges of the image, hold down the shift key,
depress and drag the corner until the image is a reasonable size, then move
the pointer onto the dark part of the image, depress the mouse and drag until
the image is properly positioned.
<P>
<IMG SRC="C3.png" WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="283">
<P>
If you have downloaded the
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/autotrace/">autotrace program</A>
you can invoke <CODE>Element-&gt;AutoTrace</CODE> to generate an outline
from the image. But if you have not you must add points yourself. Change
the active layer to be the foreground, and go to the tools palette and select
the round (or curve) point. Then move the pointer to the edge of the image
and add a point. I find that it is best to add points at places where the
curve is horizontal or vertical, at corners, or where the curve changes
inflection (A change of inflection occurs in a curve like "S" where the curve
changes from being open to the left to being open on the right. If you follow
these rules hinting will work better.
<P>
<IMG SRC="C4.png" WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="283">
<P>
It is best to enter a curve in a clockwise fashion, so the next point should
be added up at the top of the image on the flat section. Because the shape
becomes flat here, a curve point is not appropriate, rather a tangent point
is (this looks like a little triangle on the tools palette). A tangent point
makes a nice transition from curves to straight lines because the curve leaves
the point with the same slope the line had when it entered.
<P>
<IMG SRC="C5.png" WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="283">
<P>
At the moment this "curve" doesn't match the image at all, don't worry about
that we'll fix it later, and anyway it will change on its own as we continue.
Note that we now have a control point attached to the tangent point (the
little blue x). The next point needs to go where the image changes direction
abruptly. Neither a curve nor a tangent point is appropriate here, instead
we must use a corner point (one of the little squares on the tools palette).
<P>
<IMG SRC="C6.png" WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="283">
<P>
As you see the old curve now follows the image a bit more closely. We continue
adding points until we are ready to close the path.
<P>
<IMG SRC="C7.png" WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="283">
<P>
Then we close the path just by adding a new point on top of the old start
point
<P>
<IMG SRC="C8.png" WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="283">
<P>
Now we must make the curve track the image more closely, to do this we must
adjust the control points (the blue "x"es). To make all the control points
visible select the pointer tool and double-click on the curve and then move
the control points around until the curve looks right.
<P>
<IMG SRC="C9.png" WIDTH="266" HEIGHT="279">
<P>
Finally we set width. Again with the pointer tool, move the mouse to the
width line on the right edge of the screen, depress and drag the line back
to a reasonable location.
<P>
<IMG SRC="C10.png" WIDTH="266" HEIGHT="279">
<P>
And we are done with this character.
