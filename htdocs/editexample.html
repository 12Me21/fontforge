  Font creation
</H1>
<P>
First create a new font with the <CODE>New</CODE> command in the
<CODE>File</CODE> menu (or by using the <KBD>-new</KBD> argument at startup).
<P>
<IMG SRC="newfont.png" WIDTH="419" HEIGHT="189">
<P>
Give the font a name with the <CODE><A HREF="fontinfo.html">Font
Info</A></CODE> command from the <CODE>Element</CODE> menu. You use this
same command to change the encoding (ie what characters are available in
the font), set the copyright message and change the ascent and descent (the
sum of these two determines the size of the em square for the font, and by
convention is 1000).
<P>
<IMG SRC="fontinfo.png" WIDTH="354" HEIGHT="374">
<P>
Once you have done that you are read to start editing characters. Double
click on the entry for "C" in the font view above. You should now have an
empty Outline Character window:
<P>
<IMG SRC="C1.png" WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="283">
<P>
Select the Import command from the File menu and import an image of the character
you are creating. It will be scaled so that it is as high as the em-square.
<P>
<IMG SRC="C2.png" WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="283">
<P>
Select the background layer as editable from the layers palette, move the
mouse pointer to one of the edges of the image, hold down the shift key,
depress and drag the corner until the image is a reasonable size, then move
the pointer onto the dark part of the image, depress the mouse and drag until
the image is properly positioned.
<P>
<IMG SRC="C3.png" WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="283">
<P>
If you have downloaded the
<A HREF="http://homepages.go.com/~martweb/AutoTrace.htm">autotrace program</A>
you can invoke <CODE>Element-&gt;AutoTrace</CODE> to generate an outline
from the image. But if you have not you must add points yourself. Change
the active layer to be the foreground, and go to the tools palette and select
the round (or curve) point. Then move the pointer to the edge of the image
and add a point. I find that it is best to add points at places where the
curve is horizontal or vertical, or changes inflection.
<P>
<IMG SRC="C4.png" WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="283">
<P>
It is best to enter a curve in a clockwise fashion, so the next point should
be added up at the top of the image on the flat section. Because it is flat,
a curve point is not appropriate here, rather a tangent point is (this looks
like a little triangle on the tools palette). A tangent point makes a nice
transition from curves to straight lines because the curve leaves the point
with the same slope the line had when it entered.
<P>
<IMG SRC="C5.png" WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="283">
<P>
At the moment this "curve" doesn't match the image at all, don't worry about
that we'll fix it later, and anyway it will change on its own as we continue.
Note that we now have a control point attached to the tangent point (the
little blue x). The next point needs to go where the image changes direction
abruptly. Neither a curve nor a tangent point is appropriate here, instead
we must use a corner point (one of the little squares on the tools palette).
<P>
<IMG SRC="C6.png" WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="283">
<P>
As you see the old curve now follows the image a bit more closely. We continue
adding points until we are ready to close the path.
<P>
<IMG SRC="C7.png" WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="283">
<P>
Then we close the path just by adding a new point on top of the old start
point
<P>
<IMG SRC="C8.png" WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="283">
<P>
Now we must make the curve track the image more closely, to do this we must
adjust the control points. To make all the control points visible select
the pointer tool and double-click on the curve and then move the control
points around until the curve looks right.
<P>
<IMG SRC="C9.png" WIDTH="266" HEIGHT="279">
<P>
Finally we set width. Again with the pointer tool, move the mouse to the
width line on the right edge of the screen, depress and drag the line back
to a reasonable location.
<P>
<IMG SRC="C10.png" WIDTH="266" HEIGHT="279">
<P>
And we are done with this character.
<P>
Do this for all the characters in the font and you have created your first
font. You can use <CODE>View-&gt;Next Char</CODE> and <CODE>View-&gt;Prev
Char</CODE> to look at additional characters.
<P>
One of the hardest tasks of all is getting to spaces around the characters
to look nice. PfaEdit has a <CODE>Metrics-&gt;Auto Width</CODE> command which
attempts to guess reasonable values for the character spacings in your font.
Just select the "All" radio button in both sets of buttons and press OK.<BR>
<IMG SRC="autowidth.png" WIDTH="276" HEIGHT="316">
<P>
At this point you might want some bitmaps to go with the postscript (this
is not compulsory). Go to <CODE>Element-&gt;Bitmaps Available</CODE> and
select the pixel sizes you want bitmaps in (Note, that on X pixel sizes often
do not correspond exactly to point sizes. You can then use the bitmap editor
(<CODE>File-&gt;Open Bitmap</CODE>) to clean up the bitmaps, or you can generate
your bitmap fonts and then
<A HREF="http://clr.nmsu.edu/~mleisher/download.html">use someone else's
bitmap editor to clean them up</A>.
<P>
<IMG SRC="BitmapView.png" WIDTH="254" HEIGHT="273">
<P>
Last of all you can generate font files. Select <CODE>File-&gt;Generate
Fonts</CODE>, select the outline font format, and which (if any) of your
bitmaps you want converted into a bdf font.
