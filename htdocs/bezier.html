PostScript uses cubic B&eacute;zier splines. Each control point determines
the slope of the spline at the corresponding end point. TrueType uses quadratic
B&eacute;zier splines, in these there is only one control point between two
end points and that point determines the slope of the spline at both end
points. Both formats also use lines (which are linear B&eacute;zier splines).
<P>
<IMG SRC="quadbezier.gif" WIDTH="113" HEIGHT="88" ALIGN="Right">It is also
possible to have other degree B&eacute;zier splines. For a quartic spline
there would be 3 control points, for a quintic 4 control points, etc. Of
these only the linear, quadratic and cubic splines are interesting to us--
those used by TrueType and PostScript. 
<P>
The examples at left are cubic splines with two control points, each determining
the slope at the nearest end point, while the example at right shows a quadratic
spline with one control point used to determine the slopes at both end points.
<P>
In general if there are n+1 points labeled P<SUB>0</SUB>, P<SUB>1</SUB>,
... P<SUB>n</SUB>, with P<SUB>0</SUB> and P<SUB>n</SUB> the end points (and
all the others control points) then the equation of the B&eacute;zier spline
between them is: <IMG SRC="Bezier.gif" WIDTH="137" HEIGHT="56" ALIGN="Middle">.
If there are two points then this is just the line between the two end points,
if three then the quadratic spline used by TrueType, if four then the cubic
spline used by PostScript.

  Converting TrueType to PostScript
</H2>
<P>
Lines convert with no math whatsoever.
<P>
Any quadratic spline can be expressed as a cubic (where the cubic term is
zero). The end points of the cubic will be the same as the quadratic's.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  CP<SUB>0</SUB> = QP<SUB>0</SUB><BR>
  CP<SUB>3</SUB> = QP<SUB>2</SUB>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The two control points for the cubic are:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  CP<SUB>1</SUB> = QP<SUB>0</SUB> + 2/3
  *(QP<SUB>1</SUB>-QP<SUB>0</SUB>)<BR>
  CP<SUB>2</SUB> = CP<SUB>1</SUB> + 1/3 *(QP<SUB>2</SUB>-QP<SUB>0</SUB>)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
So converting from TrueType to PostScript is trivial. There is a slight error
introduced due to rounding, but it is unlikely to be noticeable.
<P>
(Anish Mehta points out that in truetype it is possible to specify points
which are in the middle of a pixel (ie. with an x or y value ending in 1/2).
These will also introduce rounding errors when converted to postscript, but
here the solution is simple: Scale the em-square of the font by a factor
of 2 and the problem vanishes).
<H2>
  Converting Postscript to TrueType
</H2>
<P>
Most cubic splines cannot be represented exactly by a quadratic (or even
by a series of quadratics). The best that can be done is to approximate the
cubic to within some margin of error. Here is a way to do that:
<P>
Given a cubic spline. Look at two points on the spline. Then there is only
one possible quadratic spline between those two points which has the desired
slope at those two points. (the one quadratic has its end points as the end
points of the interval, and its control point is determined by the intersections
of the lines tangent to the cubic at the start and end of the interval).
<P>
Start from the end of the spline and every so often (ie. within the margin
of error) check to see if the one permissible quadratic approximation actually
matches the cubic closely enough .
<P>
If this approximation works then keep it as part of the result, and continue
the process by advancing our start point along to the cubic spline to the
end of the quadratic we just created.
<P>
(There are some slight complexities introduced because there may not be a
quadratic approximation at a given point (if the tangents happen to be parallel)
or because the approximation happens to be linear, but these are easily dealt
with).
<P>
It may, of course, happen that the "cubic" we are given is actually a quadratic
(if it's third degree term is 0), the most likely cause is that the font
came from a truetype source. In that case the control point for the quadratic
is at:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  QP<SUB>1</SUB> = CP<SUB>0</SUB> + 3/2 * (CP<SUB>1</SUB> - CP<SUB>0</SUB>)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Other sources I have read on the net suggest checking the cubic spline for
points of inflection (which quadratic splines cannot have) and forcing breaks
there. To my eye this actually makes the result worse, it uses more points
and the approximation does not look as close as it does when ignoring the
points of inflection. So I ignore them.
<H2>
  Open Type, another solution
</H2>
<P>
Adobe and Microsoft decided to produce one font format which could hold either
a true type font or a postscript font. This is called Open Type. It is
essentially a superset of TrueType. Any TrueType font is a valid Open Type
font, but Open Type fonts can also contain postscript. Anything that supports
Open Type will not require converting between PostScript and True Type.
