  Printing
</H1>
<P>
PfaEdit will only produce postscript when it prints, this may be directed
to a file, a printer, ghostview or an arbetrary command.
<P>
When you choose to print you have the option of printing:
<UL>
  <LI>
    All the characters of your font, in a rectangular grid:<BR>
    <IMG SRC="FontDisplay.png" WIDTH="342" HEIGHT="109">
  <LI>
    Certain selected characters, one per page, at a scale to fill up the page<BR>
    <IMG SRC="CharPrint.png" WIDTH="283" HEIGHT="392">
  <LI>
    A sample of the font in use. This will handle kerning, bi-directional text,
    and composing characters.<BR>
    <IMG SRC="FontSample.png" WIDTH="388" HEIGHT="537">
</UL>
<P>
<IMG SRC="Print.png" WIDTH="426" HEIGHT="445" ALIGN="Right">The print dialog
appears at right. The three choices are reflected by the radio buttons (the
Full Page Character button will print any selected characters in the font
view, the current character in the outline view, and any characters displayed
in the metrics view, here it is greyed out because no characters were selected
in the font view).
<P>
The PointSize field applies to the Full Font Display and the Sample Text
methods.
<P>
The Sample Text is fairly self-explanatory. The default sample text is geared
to your font, if your font does not contain (for instance) greek characters,
then the greek will not appear. Of course you may change it however you wish...
<P>
The Setup button allows you to pick a printer, pagesize, etc.<BR Clear=ALL>
<P>
<IMG SRC="PageSetup.png" WIDTH="344" HEIGHT="260" ALIGN="Left">You may choose
to queue the result with lp or lpr, you may also direct it to ghostview,
or simply print to a file (if you send it to a file you will be prompted
for a filename after you click OK in the Print (not the PageSetup) dialog).
You can also direct the print run to any command you choose (the "Other"
option). This command must expect to find a postscript file on its standard
input, if the command needs any arguments (a common example might be the
"-" used by many commands to make them read standard input) they should be
placed in the text field with the command name.
<P>
PfaEdit knows about certain standard sizes of paper. If you want to use a
size which isn't on the list then enter it as 8.5x11in or 21x29.7cm.
<P>
PfaEdit will read your printcap file to get a list of printers. It also adds
one magic entry "&lt;default&gt;" if you select this (or if you leave the
printer blank) then lp or lpr will chose their default printer.
<P>
The Printer and Copies arguments are not meaningful when using ghostview
or printing to a file.

Obviously my samples are based on european and CJK character sets. If anyone
has a small section of text in any language not represented please send me
a copy. Preferably in a unicode encoding...
