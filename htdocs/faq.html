    Well... no. Otherwise I wouldn't be writing this.

	Traditionally each new style of art and architecture has an associated style
	of fonts. New fonts are always being created to reflect the esthetics of
	the times.
      <LI>
	Computer font technology is constantly changing. A format for a font that
	was useful 10 years ago may not be so now.

    <A NAME="widget-set"><B>Why is PfaEdit based on a non-standard widget
    set?</B></A>
  <DD>
    I wanted a widget set that would handle Unicode reasonably well. In particular
    I thought support for bidi text was important for hebrew and arabic typography.
    As I was unaware of any widget sets that did that, I wrote my own.<BR>
    I also wanted a widget set where I could actually figure out whether the
    checkbox was checked or not checked. In far too many cases my eyes can't
    work out which is which...
  <DT>
    <A NAME="hint-subs"><B>How do I make PfaEdit use hint substitution?</B></A>
  <DD>
    It happens automagically.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="flex-hints"><B>How do I make Pfaedit use flex hints?</B></A>
  <DD>
    PfaEdit will now generate flex hints in situations where it is appropriate
    to do so. You don't need to do anything. If flex hints are used then the
    necessary subroutines will be added to the font. If they are not needed then
    the subroutines will not be added.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="fuzzy"><B>My characters are all perfectly hinted, why do some stems
    have different widths (or appear fuzzy, or fade away completely)?</B></A>
  <DD>
    Both PostScript and TrueType require that characters be drawn in a clockwise
    fashion. Some rasterizers don't care. But other rasterizers will have
    difficulties with counter-clockwise paths and produced stems of different
    widths when they should be the same, or fuzzy stems, or even nothing at all.
    The solution to this is to run Element-&gt;Correct Direction on all your
    characters before generating a font.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="new-name"><B>How do I add a character with a new name?</B></A>
  <DD>
    Let's say you wanted to add a "dotlessi" character to an ISO-8859-1 font
    (this encoding does not include dotlessi). There are two ways to approach
    the problem:
    <OL>
      <LI>
	Bring up <CODE>Element-&gt;Font Info</CODE><BR>
	Select the <CODE>Encoding</CODE> tab<BR>
	Increment the <CODE>Number of Characters</CODE> field by one (probably to
	<CODE>257</CODE>)<BR>
	Press <CODE>OK</CODE><BR>
	Scroll down to the end of the font and find the new character<BR>
	Select it<BR>
	Bring up <CODE>Element-&gt;Character Info</CODE><BR>
	Type your new name into the <CODE>Unicode Name</CODE> field (in this case
	you'd type in <CODE>dotlessi</CODE>)<BR>
	Press the <CODE>Set From Name</CODE> button<BR>
	Press <CODE>OK</CODE><BR>
	Now draw a dotlessi in the character.
      <LI>
	Bring up <CODE>Element-&gt;Font Info</CODE><BR>
	Select the <CODE>Encoding</CODE> tab<BR>
	Change the <CODE>Encoding</CODE> to <CODE>ISO-10646-1 (Unicode)</CODE><BR>
	Press <CODE>OK</CODE><BR>
	Bring up <CODE>View-&gt;Goto</CODE><BR>
	Type in <CODE>dotlessi</CODE><BR>
	Press <CODE>OK</CODE><BR>
	Now draw the dotlessi character in the selected character slot<BR>
	Bring up <CODE>Element-&gt;Font Info </CODE>again<BR>
	Change the <CODE>Encoding</CODE> back to whatever it was
    </OL>
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Open-size">Why isn't my Open Type font much smaller than the .pfb
    file?</A>
  <DD>
    This is probably because you didn't round to int before saving the font.
    PfaEdit will save the font using fixed point numbers which take up a lot
    more space than normal integers.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Open-difference">What's the difference between OpenType and PostScript
    (or TrueType) fonts?</A>
  <DD>
    Both PostScript and TrueType define a file format and a glyph format. OpenType
    uses the TrueType file format with a PostScript glyph format (actually OpenType
    includes the TrueType glyph format as well, but the OpenType definition says
    they should still be called TrueType fonts so I ignore that aspect).
    <P>
    The PostScript used in OpenType is slightly different from that used in .pfa
    and .pfb files. They are Type1 fonts while OpenType uses Type2 fonts. Type2
    is almost a superset of Type1 with a few minor changes and many extensions.
    Adobe's extensions to Type1 (flex hints, hint substitution, counter hints)
    by using subroutines have been added to Type2 as direct instructions.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="save-no-change">After I generate a font and quit, why does PfaEdit
    ask if I want to save the font? I didn't change anything.</A>
  <DD>
    There are two reasons why this might be happening.
    <OL>
      <LI>
	Even though you haven't changed anything in this session, PfaEdit may need
	to (re)generate hinting information on one or several characters (if, for
	example those characters have been changed (in an earlier session) but no
	hints have been generated for them since). These new hints will mark the
	font as changed.
      <LI>
	If your font has an XUID field in the Font Info, then PfaEdit will increment
	the final number in the XUID each time a postscript font is generated --
	and this also counts as a change. (Why does PfaEdit do this? Because Adobe
	says it should. A minor annoyance, but it avoids some problems with font
	caching when you change an old version of the font for a new one).
    </OL>
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Tex">Why doesn't TeX work with my fonts?</A>
  <DD>
    I'm a total novice with TeX. I am told that TeX (or some part of the TeX
    chain, dvips perhaps) expects fonts to be encoded in TeX base Encoding --
    sometimes called "Adobe Standard" by the TeX docs, but it isn't it's TeX
    base. So if you are having printing problems, missing glyphs, etc. Try changing
    the encoding of your font to TeX Base (Go to Element-&gt;Font Info, select
    the Encoding tab, select TeX Base from the pulldown list).
  <DT>
    <A NAME="minify-iconify">Why does my window get iconified when I want to
    minify the view?</A>
  <DD>
    Some window managers (gnome-sawtooth for one) steal meta (alt) clicks from
    PfaEdit. So you can't use meta-middle-click to minify a character, you have
    to use the View menu-&gt;Zoom Out instead.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="no-mu">Why isn't there a "mu" character in my greek font?</A>
  <DD>
    Adobe was thinking more of backwards compatability than sense when they assigned
    the names of the greek letters in their unicode encoding. Thus the name "mu"
    refers to the Micro Sign (U+00B5) and not to the letter mu. They also assigned
    Delta to Increment, and Omega to Ohm Sign. I have chosen to disregard these
    latter two, but the definition of "mu" is embedded in the Latin1 encoding
    and I can't reassign it with impunity.
    <P>
    In a half-hearted attempt to get around this problem I have caused PfaEdit
    to generate characters with names "mu", "uni00B5" and "uni03BC" whenever
    either U+00B5 or U+03BC is defined.
