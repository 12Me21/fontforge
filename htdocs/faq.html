    <A NAME="widget-set"><B>Why is PfaEdit based on a non-standard widget
    set?</B></A>
  <DD>
    I wanted a widget set that would handle Unicode reasonably well. In particular
    I thought support for bidi text was important for hebrew and arabic typography.
    As I was unaware of any widget sets that did that, I wrote my own.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="hint-subs"><B>How do I make PfaEdit use hint substitution?</B></A>
  <DD>
    At the moment PfaEdit will not generate PostScript fonts using hint substitution.
    With one exception: If you load a type1 font into PfaEdit which uses hint
    substitution, modify a few characters, and then generate a new type1 font,
    then the unmodified characters will continue to use hint substitution if
    they did before.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="flex-hints"><B>How do I make Pfaedit use flex hints?</B></A>
  <DD>
    PfaEdit will now generate flex hints in situations where it is appropriate
    to do so. You don't need to do anything. If flex hints are used then the
    necessary subroutines will be added to the font. If they are not needed then
    the subroutines will not be added.

    <A NAME="new-name"><B>How do I add a character with a new name?</B></A>
  <DD>
    Let's say you wanted to add a "dotlessi" character to an ISO-8859-1 font
    (this encoding does not include dotlessi). There are two ways to approach
    the problem:
    <OL>
      <LI>
	Bring up <CODE>Element-&gt;Font Info</CODE><BR>
	Increment the <CODE>Number of Characters</CODE> field by one (probably to
	<CODE>257</CODE>)<BR>
	Press <CODE>OK</CODE><BR>
	Scroll down to the end of the font and find the new character<BR>
	Select it<BR>
	Bring up <CODE>Element-&gt;Character Info</CODE><BR>
	Type your new name into the <CODE>Unicode Name</CODE> field (in this case
	you'd type in <CODE>dotlessi</CODE>)<BR>
	Press the <CODE>Set From Name</CODE> button<BR>
	Press <CODE>OK</CODE><BR>
	Now draw a dotlessi in the character.
      <LI>
	Bring up <CODE>Element-&gt;Font Info</CODE><BR>
	Change the <CODE>Encoding</CODE> to <CODE>ISO-10646-1 (Unicode)</CODE><BR>
	Press <CODE>OK</CODE><BR>
	Bring up <CODE>View-&gt;Goto</CODE><BR>
	Type in <CODE>dotlessi</CODE><BR>
	Press <CODE>OK</CODE><BR>
	Now draw the dotlessi character in the selected character slot<BR>
	Bring up <CODE>Element-&gt;Font Info </CODE>again<BR>
	Change the <CODE>Encoding</CODE> back to whatever it was
    </OL>

    <A NAME="Open-size">Why isn't my Open Type font much smaller than the .pfb
    file?</A>
  <DD>
    This is probably because you didn't round to int before saving the font.
    PfaEdit will save the font using fixed point numbers which take up a lot
    more space than normal integers.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Open-difference">What's the difference between OpenType and PostScript
    (or TrueType) fonts?</A>
  <DD>
    Both PostScript and TrueType define a file format and a glyph format. OpenType
    uses the TrueType file format with a PostScript glyph format (actually OpenType
    includes the TrueType glyph format as well, but the OpenType definition says
    they should still be called TrueType fonts so I ignore that aspect).
    <P>
    The PostScript used in OpenType is slightly different from that used in .pfa
    and .pfb files. They are Type1 fonts while OpenType uses Type2 fonts. Type2
    is almost a superset of Type1 with a few minor changes and many extension.
    Adobe's extensions to Type1 (flex hints, hint substitution, counter hints)
    by using subroutines have been added to Type2 as direct instructions.
