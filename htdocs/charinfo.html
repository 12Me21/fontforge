<P>
This dialog allows you to set the name and unicode encoding of a given character.
If you know the name of the character then PfaEdit can tell you the encoding
(if you press Set From Name), similarly if you know the encoding then PfaEdit
can tell you the name.
<P>
The name field contains a pull down list with (possibly) several synonyms for the
name of this unicode code point.
<P>
Most characters are part of a script system. All this text I am writing
is in the latin script. Greek, cyrillic, arabic, hebrew, chinese ideographs,
katakana, hangul, devangari, etc. are others. Generally PfaEdit is able to
guess the script correctly, but sometimes it will get it wrong (or will not
have enough data to hazard a guess). Scripts are important for the
<A HREF="gposgsub.html">GPOS and GSUB</A> tables in truetype and opentype
fonts. If you aren't interested in these font formats you may safely ignore
this item. Otherwise there is a pull-down list with the common scripts listed.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>
<IMG SRC="charinfo-comment.png" WIDTH="307" HEIGHT="359" ALIGN="Right">You can assign an arbetrary (unicode) comment to the character. Simply type
any text into this field. The comment is for your use, it will not go into
any generated fonts. You may also assign a color to a character to make it
stand out in the font view.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>
<IMG SRC="charinfo-lig.png" WIDTH="307" HEIGHT="359" ALIGN="Right">The ligature field allows you to tell PfaEdit that the current character
is a ligature composed of several other characters. PfaEdit will often be
able to fill this in with the right default value, but occasionally you may
want to change it. The value should be a list of postscript character names
separated by spaces. If a character may be viewed as two different ligatures
then they may both be specified separated by a semicolon. For example "ffi"
may be viewed as a ligature of "f" "f" and "i" or of "ff" and "i", the
specification should be "f f i; ff i"
<P>
The <A HREF="gposgsub.html">GPOS and GSUB</A> tables allow further refinements
of ligatures. You may classify a ligature as: Standard, Required, Discretionary,
Historic or Fraction. Required ligatures must be replaced, Standard ligatures
should be, Discretionary ones may be, and Historic ones should only be used
int appropriate circumstances. The pull down list on the Tag field allows you
to pick what type of ligature this should be.
<P>
Some characters (ligatures, accented characters, Hangul syllables, etc.)
are built up out of other characters. Displayed underneath the ligature field
are the components of the current character, if those componants are in the
font then you can use PfaEdit's Element-&gt;Build Accented or
Element-&gt;Build Composit commands to create the current character. The
information displayed here is informative only, you may not change this field
directly.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>
In the font view the Next and Prev buttons are not greyed out and you can
change move on to the next character (if, for example, you need to enter
encodings for a range of characters).
<P>
The Done (or Cancel) button only Cancels work in the current character. If
you have already used Next or Prev then those earlier changes will not be
cancelled.<BR Clear=Right>
