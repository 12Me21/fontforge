  <A NAME="Unicode">This dialog </A>allows you to set the name and unicode
  encoding of a given glyph. If you know the name of the glyph then FontForge
  can tell you the encoding (if you press Set From Name), similarly if you
  know the encoding then FontForge can tell you the name.
  <P>
  The name field contains a pull down list with (possibly) several synonyms
  for the name of this unicode code point.
  <P>
  The Glyph class field is for the opentype 'GDEF' table. You can usually leave
  it set to automatic. FontForge will then figure out the class, and whether
  it should be output into GDEF. You can see what FontForge does in
  <A HREF="showatt.html">View-&gt;Show ATT</A>.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="charinfo-comment.png" WIDTH="307" HEIGHT="359" ALIGN="Right">You
  can assign an arbitrary (unicode) <A NAME="comment">comment</A> to the glyph.
  Simply type any text into this field. The comment is for your use, it will
  not go into any generated fonts. You may also assign a color to a glyph to
  make it stand out in the font view.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="charinfo-pos.png" WIDTH="359" HEIGHT="313" ALIGN="Right">There
  are 6 separate sub-dialogs to help you edit the
  <A NAME="features" HREF="lookups.html">lookups</A> of the
  <A HREF="gposgsub.html">GPOS and GSUB</A> tables (some of these data can
  be converted into various of Apple's AAT tables, particularly 'morx'). Lookups
  and their subtables are described in some detail
  <A HREF="overview.html#Lookups">here</A>, and may be manipulated and created
  with the <A HREF="fontinfo.html#Lookups">Element-&gt;Font Info</A> commmand.
  <P>
  The first of sub-dialogs is the alternate <A NAME="position">position</A>
  pane which allows you to associate certain modifications to a glyph's metrics
  with a feature in the GPOS table.
  <P>
  In the example at right the first lookup subtable (which is associated with
  the Scientific Inferiors feature) will move the y position of the glyph down
  by 900 em-units, while the second subtable will move it down by 560 em-units.
  Positioning subtables can also move glyphs horizontally and can adjust the
  horizontal and vertical advances of the glyph. If you have configured FontForge
  to support them you can also add device tables for pixel level corrections
  to these adjustments. Most subtables will use only a few of the possibilities
  open to them and FontForge generally hides unused columns -- but if you want
  to see them just turn off [*] Hide Unused Columns.
  <P>
  A new entry in the list may be created by pressing the &lt;New&gt; button
  and a popup menu will appear with all possible lookup subtables you could
  add data to.
  <P>
  The <A NAME="pairwise">pairwise</A> positioning sub-dialog allows you to
  change the positions of two glyphs when they occur next to one another --
  better know as kerning. I think the <A HREF="metricsview.html">Metrics View
  </A>provides a better place to do kerning, but you can do it here if you
  wish.<BR Clear=Right>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="charinfo-subs.png" WIDTH="474" HEIGHT="315" ALIGN="Right"> A simple
  <A NAME="substitution">substitution</A> replaces one glyph with another.
  Here the glyph "one" has a series of substitutions to various glyphs depending
  on what lookup subtable is invoked.
  <P>
  The <A NAME="multiple">multiple</A> and alternate substitution sub-dialogs
  are very similar to this one except that they can take multiple glyph names.
  In a multiple substitution subtable each glyph is replaced by several other
  glyphs (sort of the reverse of a ligature), while in the alternate substitution
  sub-dialog each glyph is to be replaced by exactly one glyph from a list
  and the user is to be given a choice as to which glyph is to be chosen.

  <IMG SRC="charinfo-lig.png" WIDTH="411" HEIGHT="312" ALIGN="Right"> The
  <A NAME="ligature">ligature</A> pane allows you to tell FontForge that the
  current glyph is a ligature composed of several other glyphs. FontForge will
  sometimes be able to fill this in with the right default value, but not always.
  The value should be a list of postscript glyph names separated by spaces.
  If a glyph may be viewed as two different ligatures then they may both be
  specified in different lines. For example "ffi" may be viewed as a ligature
  of "f" "f" and "i" or of "ff" and "i".
  <P>

  <IMG SRC="charinfo-counters.png" WIDTH="307" HEIGHT="409" ALIGN="Right">
  In complicated Asian glyphs, postscript has a mechanism for controlling the
  width of <A NAME="CounterMasks">counters</A> between stems. These are called
  counter mask
  hints<IMG SRC="newcountermask.png" WIDTH="282" HEIGHT="392" ALIGN="Left">.
  In Latin, Cyrillic, Greek fonts only glyphs like "m" are allowed to have
  counter masks, and only in very controlled conditions. See the description
  of <A HREF="hinting.html#Counter">counter masks</A>.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="charinfo-counters.png" WIDTH="307" HEIGHT="409" ALIGN="Right">
  Some <A NAME="components">glyphs</A> (ligatures, accented glyphs, Hangul
  syllables, etc.) are built up out of other glyphs (at least according to
  unicode). This pane of the dlg shows the components that Unicode says make
  up the current glyph, if those components are in the font then you can use
  FontForge's <KBD>Element-&gt;Build-&gt;Build Accented </KBD>or
  <KBD>Element-&gt;Build-&gt;Build Composite</KBD> commands to create the current
  glyph. The information displayed here is informative only, you may not change
  this field directly (it changes when you change the unicode value or glyph
  name associated with this glyph).<BR CLEAR=ALL>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="charinfo-tex.png" ALIGN="Right" WIDTH="429" HEIGHT="333"> The
  <A NAME="TeX">TeX</A> pane allows you to specify glyph specific information
  used in TeX tmf files. The height and depth fields are often the same as
  the glyph's bounding box (if you don't fill these in that's what fontforge
  will use by default), but they should be corrected for optical distortion,
  so in glyphs like "o" these fields should be clipped to the x-height and
  baseline (ff isn't smart enough to do this for you).
  <P>
  The Subscript and Superscript Positions are only used in TeX Math (and
  Math-extension) fonts.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
  <P>
  The Next and Prev buttons allow you to move from one glyph to the next (if,
  for example, you need to enter encodings for a range of glyphs).
  <P>
  The Done (or Cancel) button only Cancels work in the current glyph. If you
  have already used Next or Prev then those earlier changes will not be
  cancelled.<BR Clear=Right>
