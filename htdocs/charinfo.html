  Char Info

  <IMG SRC="charinfo.png" WIDTH="217" HEIGHT="291" ALIGN="Right">
  <A NAME="Character">Character</A> Info
</H2>
<P>
This dialog allows you to set the name and unicode encoding of a given character.
If you know the name of the character then PfaEdit can tell you the encoding
(if you press Set From Name), similarly if you know the encoding then PfaEdit
can tell you the name.
<P>
The name field contains a pull down list with (possibly) several synonyms
for the name of this unicode code point.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>
<IMG SRC="charinfo-comment.png" WIDTH="307" HEIGHT="359" ALIGN="Right">You
can assign an arbetrary (unicode) comment to the character. Simply type any
text into this field. The comment is for your use, it will not go into any
generated fonts. You may also assign a color to a character to make it stand
out in the font view.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>
<IMG SRC="charinfo-pos.png" WIDTH="305" HEIGHT="400" ALIGN="Right">There
are 6 seperate sub-dialogs to help you edit the <A HREF="gposgsub.html">GPOS
and GSUB</A> tables (some of these data can be converted into various of
Apple's AAT tables, particularly 'morx'). The first of these is the alternate
position dialog which allows you to associate certain modifications to a
character's metrics with a feature in the GPOS table.
<P>
In the example at right the 'fwid' feature (full width) adds 400 units to
the character's advance width and moves it horizontally by 200 units.
<P>
A new entry in the list may be created by pressing the [New] button and a
<A HREF="#Feature-Tag">dlg</A> will pop up with fields for the metrics you
can change. It will also have a field for a feature tag, and a set of check
boxes for flags (these flags are not relevant here, but are included as an
excercise in assinine completeness.
<P>
The [Delete] and [Edit] buttons should be fairly self-explanitory. [Copy]
and [Paste] work as expected too. You can also paste something copied here
into the font view (if you wish to have the same position information available
in a large block of characters).
<P>
The pairwise positioning sub-dialog allows you to change the positions of
two characters when they occur next to one another. The most common example
of that is kerning (which is better done elsewhere, the metricsview for example,
but it can be done here if you really want to do that).<BR Clear=Right>
<P>
<IMG SRC="charinfo-subs.png" WIDTH="305" HEIGHT="400" ALIGN="Right"> A simple
substitution replaces one glyph with another. Here the glyph "one" has a
substitution to "onesuperior" when the 'sups' (Superscript) feature is invoked.
<P>
PfaEdit recognizes a special feature tag ' RQD' to indicate that this feature
is required for the given script/language. Such a feature will always be
applied.
<P>
You can generate a substitution most easily by draging a character from the
font view and droping it here (you will then be <A HREF="#Feature-Tag">prompted
for a feature tag</A> for the substitution table.
<P>
The multiple and alternate substitution sub-dialogs are very similar to this
one except that they can take multiple glyph names. In a multiple substitution
sub table each glyph is replaced by several other glyphs (sort of the reverse
of a ligature), while in the alternate substitution sub-dialog each glyph
is to be replaced by exactly one glyph from a list and the user is to be
given a choice as to which glyph is to be chosen. <BR Clear=Right>
<P>
<IMG SRC="charinfo-lig.png" WIDTH="305" HEIGHT="400" ALIGN="Right"> The
<A NAME="ligature">ligature</A> field allows you to tell PfaEdit that the
current character is a ligature composed of several other characters. PfaEdit
will often be able to fill this in with the right default value, but occasionally
you may want to change it. The value should be a list of postscript character
names separated by spaces. If a character may be viewed as two different
ligatures then they may both be specified in different lines. For example
"ffi" may be viewed as a ligature of "f" "f" and "i" or of "ff" and "i".
<P>
In the example at right the "m" character is one of a set of flags stored
in the GSUB table. It indicates that combining marks should be ignored when
looking for the ligature.
<P>
The <A HREF="gposgsub.html">GPOS and GSUB</A> tables allow further refinements
of ligatures. You may classify a ligature as: Standard, Required, Discretionary,
Historic or Fraction. Required ligatures must be replaced, Standard ligatures
should be, Discretionary ones may be, and Historic ones should only be used
int appropriate circumstances. The pull down list on the Tag field allows
you to pick what type of ligature this should be. <BR Clear=Right>
<P>
<IMG SRC="charinfo-comp.png" WIDTH="305" HEIGHT="400" ALIGN="Right"> Some
characters (ligatures, accented characters, Hangul syllables, etc.) are built
up out of other characters. Displayed underneath the ligature field are the
components of the current character, if those componants are in the font
then you can use PfaEdit's Element-&gt;Build Accented or Element-&gt;Build
Composit commands to create the current character. The information displayed
here is informative only, you may not change this field directly.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>
The Next and Prev buttons allow you to move from one character to the next
(if, for example, you need to enter encodings for a range of characters).
<P>
The Done (or Cancel) button only Cancels work in the current character. If
you have already used Next or Prev then those earlier changes will not be
cancelled.<BR Clear=Right>

  <A NAME="Feature-Tag">Feature Tag Dialog</A>
</H3>
<P>
These two dialogs allow you to specify an otf feature tag and all the other
impedimentia that go along with it. They are used by
<A HREF="charinfo.html#Character">Character Info</A> (above) to specify
substitutions, positions, and ligatures, as well as by
<A HREF="fontinfo.html#Anchors">Font Info</A> to specify anchor classes.
<P>
In addition to a feature tag (see the section on <A HREF="gposgsub.html">GPOS
and GSUB</A> for feature tags), you must specify a set of flags and a collection
of scripts and languages for which the substitution will be active. In the
example above the substitution is active for the greek script and the default
language (which here means all languages as none have been singled out for
special treatment), the cyrillic script and the default language, and the
latin script and several languages.
<P>
<IMG SRC="scriptlist-pulldown.png" WIDTH="243" HEIGHT="118">
<P>
Clicking on the pulldown list produces a list of choices that are currently
used in the font. The last choice allows you to change or add to this list.
<P>
Most of the time you will want to specify that your item should be active
in just one script but in all languages of that script. For instance the
"fl" ligature should probably always be applied in the latin script, no matter
what the language is (except Turkish where ligatures should be explicitly
disabled), however there is no point in having it active for cyrillic users
as they will never see that combination of characters. On the other hand
the es-zet ligature (German double-s, &szlig;) has fallen by the wayside
in all (I think) languages but German so that ligature should only be active
for the latin script, german language. And there are some characters that
don't fall into one single script. The same digits are used for latin, cyrillic,
greek, hebrew, (sometimes arabic) and many other script systems, so any ligatures
of the digits (such as fractions) should be available in all script systems.
<P>
The script names used by PfaEdit are those specified by
<A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/opentype/appendices/scripttags.jsp">Microsoft
and Adobe for opentype</A>. These are almost compatible with
<A HREF="http://www.evertype.com/standards/iso15924/document/dis15924.pdf">ISO
15924</A> except that all opentype scripts are in lower case (while those
in ISO 15924 all start with capital letters) and short script names (such
as "Lao") are converted to 'lao ' rather than 'Laoo'. I have extended the
set of opentype scripts with many of those in ISO 15924 by making them all
lower case (I have not used everything from ISO 15924 because it contains
script variants for things which I consider to be one script (eg. fraktur
has a seperate script tag, but I consider it to be latin). I have also guessed
at codes for Limbu, Tai Le, and Ugaritic ('limb','tail','ugrt'), which are
scripts used in Unicode but not defined in ISO 15924.

  <A NAME="ScriptLang">The Script Language Dialog</A>
</H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="scriptlist.png" WIDTH="296" HEIGHT="205" ALIGN="Left">This dialog
shows all the script and language combinations which are in use in the current
font. You may add a new combination or change an old one by pressing the
obvious buttons.
<P>
If you want to specify a script or language that PfaEdit doesn't know about,
then hold the control key down when pressing the [New...] or [Edit] buttons
and you will get an unparsed dlg which will allow you to enter whatever you
like (OpenType does not give a tag for the default language (it is has a
special representation which does not involve tags), but for the sake of
consistance I have assigned it the tag of 'dflt'. No 'dflt' tags will appear
in the output font, instead they will be converted to the appropirate
representation for the default language).
<P>
The language names used by PfaEdit are those specified by
<A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/opentype/appendices/languagetags.jsp">Microsoft

  <A NAME="Script"><IMG SRC="scriptsdlg.png" WIDTH="152" HEIGHT="215" ALIGN="Right">The
  Script Dialog</A>
</H3>
<P>
This dialog shows all the scripts currently activated in this script-language
collection. If you want to add a new script to the collection hold the control
key down while clicking on the script. New scripts are added with the "default"
language selected. If you want finer control over languages (ie. want to
specify a language other than default) then double click on a script and
you will get a dialog of languages.
<H3>
  <IMG SRC="langdlg.png" WIDTH="152" HEIGHT="215" ALIGN="Left">The
  <A NAME="Language">Language</A> Dialog
</H3>
<P>
This shows all languages active in the current script in the current
script-language collection. Some languages are not meaningful in a given
script (but I don't know enough to know which to remove so I include all
possible languages and appologize for extranious information). Use the control
key to select multiple languages. At least one language must be
specified.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
