This dialog allows you to select characters which:
<UL>
  <LI>
    are ligatures
    <UL>
      <LI>
	In which case you may further restrict the search by specifying a ligature
	tag ('liga', 'rlig', etc.) or a list of several tags ('liga rlig'). You may
	also require that the ligature contain a character with the given name.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    have a simple substitution transformation
    <UL>
      <LI>
	In which case you may further restrict the search by specifying a ligature
	tag ('onum', 'swsh', etc.) or a list of several tags ('onum swsh'). You may
	also require that the substitution be to a character with the given name.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    have an alternate substitution transformation
    <UL>
      <LI>
	In which case you may further restrict the search by specifying a ligature
	tag ('salt', 'swsh', etc.) or a list of several tags ('salt swsh'). You may
	also require that at least one of the alternates be a character with the
	given name.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    have a multiple substitution transformation
    <UL>
      <LI>
	In which case you may further restrict the search by specifying a ligature
	tag ('ccmp'). You may also require that at least one of the alternates be
	a character with the given name.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    have a simple position transformation
    <UL>
      <LI>
	In which case you may further restrict the search by specifying a ligature
	tag ('lfbd', 'rtbd', etc.) or a list of several tags ('lfbd rtbd').
    </UL>
  <LI>
    be involved in a kerning combination
    <UL>
      <LI>
	In which case you may further restrict the search by specifying a character
	it must kern with.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    Be involved in an anchored-pair combination
    <UL>
      <LI>
	In which case you may further restrict the search by specifying the anchor
	class.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    Have a ligature caret
</UL>
<P>
There are three variants on how the search behaves:
<OL>
  <LI>
    The selection will be set to whatever characters match the search criteria
  <LI>
    The selection will be expanded. Anything that was previously selected will
    remain so, and anything that matches the search criteria will become selected.
  <LI>
    The selection will be restricted. Only characters previously selected will
    be searched, the selection will be restricted to those which match<BR>
    So if you want to search for all ligatures containing both "f" and "i"...<BR>
    Search for ligatures containing "f" with "&lt;*&gt; Select Results" set<BR>
    Then Search for ligatures containing "i" with &lt;*&gt; Restrict Selection"
    set
</OL>
