  Get Info
</H1>
<P>
In the Outline View the Get Info command can generate one of four different
dialogs depending on what is selected. If one thing is selected, and that
thing is a point then the point info dialog is brought up, if one thing is
selected and that thing is a reference then the reference dialog is brought
up, if one thing is selected and it is a background image then the image
dialog is brought up. Otherwise the <A HREF="#Character">Character info</A>
dialog is brought up.
<H2>
  Point Info
</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="pointinfo.png" WIDTH="254" HEIGHT="295" ALIGN="Right"> This shows
information about the current point. The Base position is where the point
itself is. The Next CP shows both the location of the next control point,
and the offset to that point from the base (and whether this setting is the
default for that point), while the Prev CP does the same for the previous
control point. You may change any of these and the change is reflected in
the outline view. You may move on to the next or previous point on the path.
If you cancel then all changes to all points are canceled.
<P>
The colors of the labels reflect the colors of the items they refer to. The
point itself will be drawn in red, the previous control point will be drawn
in magenta and the next control point will be drawn in dull cyan.

<H2>
  <A NAME="Character">Character</A> Info
</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="charinfo.png" WIDTH="276" HEIGHT="362" ALIGN="Right"> This dialog
allows you to set the name and unicode encoding of a given character. If
you know the name of the character then PfaEdit can tell you the encoding
(if you press Set From Name), similarly if you know the encoding then PfaEdit
can tell you the name.
<P>
The ligature field allows you to tell PfaEdit that the current character
is a ligature composed of several other characters. PfaEdit will often be
able to fill this in with the right default value, but occasionally you may
want to change it. The value should be a list of postscript character names
separated by spaces. If a character may be viewed as two different ligatures
then they may both be specified separated by a semicolon. For example "ffi"
may be viewed as a ligature of "f" "f" and "i" or of "ff" and "i", the
specification should be "f f i; ff i"
<P>
Some characters (ligatures, accented characters, Hangul syllables, etc.)
are built up out of other characters. Displayed underneath the ligature field
are the components of the current character, if those componants are in the
font then you can use PfaEdit's Element-&gt;Build Accented or
Element-&gt;Build Composit commands to create the current character. The
information displayed here is informative only, you may not change this field
directly. 
<P>
In the font view the Next and Prev buttons are not greyed out and you can
change move on to the next character (if, for example, you need to enter
encodings for a range of characters).
<P>
The Cancel (or Done) button only Cancels work in the current character. If
you used Next or Prev then those changes will not be cancelled.
<H2>
  Reference Info
</H2>
<P>
This dialog shows the name of the selected reference, its encoding in the
font and its postscript transformation matrix. Currently you may not alter
anything here, it is purely informational. There is a button in the dialog
which will open another character outline view showing the character being
referred to.
<H2>
  Image Info
</H2>
<P>
This dialog gives the offset to the lower left corner of the image and the
scale factors applied to the image. Currently you may not alter anything
here, it is purely informational.
