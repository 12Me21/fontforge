  <P>
  The Auto Width command will attempt to guess reasonable widths (more accurately
  reasonable left and right side bearings) for your font. The command splits
  the selection into scripts and looks at all possible combinations of selected
  glyphs within each script.
  <P>
  The Separation text box allows you to say how close you want the glyphs to
  be. If you look at a vertical bar (or sanserif "I"), and you autowidth it
  the sum of the left and right side bearings will be equal to the spacing.
  The min and max values will prevent sidebearings from becoming unrealistically
  large (these rarely matter).
  <P>
  Adjusting the left and right bearings of a letter will also adjust the left
  and right bearings of all accented letters based (by reference) on it. You
  should not try to use AutoWidth on accented letters directly (unless those
  glyphs do not use references).<BR Clear=Right>

  <P>
  There used to be an Auto Kern dialog. There is no longer, this is now done
  in the <A HREF="lookups.html#Pair">kerning subtable</A> dialog and the
  <A HREF="metricsview.html#kernclass">kerning class </A>dialog.
