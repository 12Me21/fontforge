<P>
The Auto Width command will attempt to guess reasonable widths (more accurately
reasonable left and right side bearings) for your font. The command looks
at all possible combinations of indicated characters (if you request more
than 300 characters it will only look at the first 300 to avoid running out
of memory (300*300 takes up a fair amount of room).
<P>
Do <FONT COLOR="Red"><EM>NOT </EM></FONT>attempt to mix scripts that are
not artistically similar. PfaEdit will be very confused if you try to run
autowidth on a Latin "I" and a Hebrew "Aleph". Latin, Greek and Cyrillic
can usually be intermixed since they evolved together and the letterforms
are similar.
<P>
You must specify two different sets, one for the character on the left (which
will have its right side bearing adjusted) and one for the character on the
right (which will have its left side bearing adjusted. I know that sounds
backwards but think about it a little), of course these two sets may be the
same. You may apply the command to all characters in the font (if there are
few than 300 of course), to all the selected characters, the the characters
A-Z, a-z and 0-9, to similar combinations for greek and cyrillic, or to a
list of characters you specify yourself (characters may be specified either
by themselves or by a range, so "ace-g" means the characters a, c, e, f and
g (if you put commas and spaces in the list they will be treated as characters.
If you want to specify a hyphen, put it first or last, so "-a-z" means hyphen
and all letters a-z)). <A HREF="metricsview.html#Entering">For information
on entering non-ASCII characters see that section in the metrics view</A>,
ranges are based on Unicode code points.
<P>
<IMG SRC="autowidthmenu.png" WIDTH="276" HEIGHT="268" ALIGN="Right">Last
of all the Spacing text box allows you to say how close you want the characters
to be. If you look at a sanserif capital I, and you autowidth it with itself
(and nothing else) the sum of the left and right side bearings should be
equal to the spacing. By default the spacing will be set to the size of the
lower case n. If you have serifs and curved letters things are more complex,
but that is roughly what's going on. You may need to adjust it to suit your
own preferences.
<P>
Adjusting the left and right bearings of a letter will also adjust the left
and right bearings of all accented letters based (by reference) on it. You
should not try to use AutoWidth on accented letters directly (unless those
characters do not use references).<BR Clear=Right>

  <A NAME="AutoKern">Auto
  Kern</A><IMG SRC="autokern.png" WIDTH="276" HEIGHT="391" ALIGN="Right">
</H2>
<P>
The Auto Kern dialog looks almost exactly like the Auto Width dialog above.
<P>
The Spacing entry defaults slightly differently, it will be the sum of the
left and right bearings for the capital I (it is assumed that the font has
already been spaced, so this will give a more accurate value than using the
size of an "n").
<P>
The threshold says that any kern pair whose absolute value is less than the
threshold value will be ignored. Set this to 0 if you want all kerns.
<P>
Some systems have a maximum number of kerning pairs that they can deal with.
If this is true for you then set "Total Kerns" to this value.
<P>
The characters are specified as they are for AutoWidth above, except that
here it is also possible to load a set of kerning pairs out of a file. For
instance in the dlg at right many unnecessary letter combinations will be
checked, and kerning information generated for them, (the combination "xq"
might well generate a kern, that letter pair will almost never occur in written
English (or any other language)). Instead you can specify (with the [Browse...]
button) that a file should be read, and only those pairs found in the file
used.
<P>
I have provided a <A HREF="englishkernpairs.txt">sample file </A>containing
some kerning pairs common in English (it is actually copied from
<A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/pdfs/tn/5091.Design_MM_Fonts.pdf">Adobe
Technical Note 5091</A>). The format of this file is just a set of lines
containing two characters per line. A kerning pair will be checked for each
pair of characters (any lines with more or fewer characters than 2 will be
treated as comment lines and ignored). The file may be either in latin1 encoding
or in UCS2 (if in UCS2 it should begin with the byte order marker U+FEFF).
You may also specify a character by writing out U+xxxx where xxxx gives the
unicode encoding. So "Av" could be represented as "U+0041v".
<P>
For each character pair, it will set the sum of <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;right bearing of
left character&gt; + &lt;left bearing of right character&gt; + &lt;kern&gt;
= &lt;spacing&gt; + &lt;character shape fudge factor&gt;.
<P>
The "fudge factor" is determined by looking at the shape of the left and
right edges of the characters (ignoring the areas that are in serifs). It
looks for the closest approach of the two characters and performs a complicated
average to figure out the fudge. If that fudge would lead to a &lt;kern&gt;
which causes any characters to be too close together then it is adjusted
up. The exact method is subject to change as bugs are found.
<P>
If the absolute value of a &lt;kern&gt; is less than the threshold then no
kerning information will be produced for that pair of characters. If the
algorithm (and any previously existing kern pairs) lead to more pairs than
specified by "Total Kerns" then a new threshold value will be determined
and any pairs whose &lt;kern&gt; is less (in absolute value) than this new
threshold will be removed.
<P>
Kerning information will not be propegated from base characters to accented
characters which refer to them. This is because "Ve" will probably have a
rather different kerning value than "V&egrave;". Note that this is different
from the way AutoWidth behaves.
<P>
Remember kerning is not part of a PostScript&reg; font, whatever word processor
you use needs to read the kerning information from the afm file and, while
kerning is part of truetype (and opentype) fonts, the Windows does not support
kerning either.
