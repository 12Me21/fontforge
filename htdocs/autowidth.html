  <P>
  The Auto Width command will attempt to guess reasonable widths (more accurately
  reasonable left and right side bearings) for your font. The command splits
  the selection into scripts and looks at all possible combinations of selected
  glyphs within each script.
  <P>
  The Separation text box allows you to say how close you want the glyphs to
  be. If you look at a vertical bar (or sanserif "I"), and you autowidth it
  the sum of the left and right side bearings will be equal to the spacing.
  The min and max values will prevent sidebearings from becoming unrealistically
  large (these rarely matter).
  <P>
  Adjusting the left and right bearings of a letter will also adjust the left
  and right bearings of all accented letters based (by reference) on it. You
  should not try to use AutoWidth on accented letters directly (unless those
  glyphs do not use references).<BR Clear=Right>

  There used to be an Auto Kern dialog. There is no longer, this is now done

  <P>
  When FontForge does AutoKerning (and in a more complicated fashion, when
  it does AutoWidthing) it tries to guess the optical separation between two
  glyphs, and then it applies an appropriate kern value to make the optical
  separation be the desired spacing.
  <P>
  FontForge assumes that the optical spacing is linear (so if you increase
  the separation between two glyphs by 3 em-units, then the optical spacing
  will also increase by 3 em-units).
  <P>
  FF guesses the separation between two glyphs by figuring a value for the
  separation of two glyphs when their bounding boxes are adjacent. For two
  rectangles (where the bounding box is the same as the glyph itself) the
  separation will be 0 as the two glyphs will be touching. For a combination
  like "To" the optical separation will be quite large.

  The GlyphSeparationHook is a python routine which will be called with a bunch
  of information about two glyphs, and is expected to return an integer
  representing the optical separation between the two. It is a low-level routine;
  the actual calculation of kerning offsets or setting glyph widths is done
  elsewhere, but this routine provides the information those higher level routines
  need. Of course, if you don't provide a routine, FontForge has a built-in
  routine which will provide a default behavior. Here is a python version of
  that default routine:
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE>import fontforge;

def GlyphSeparation(onLeft,onRight,denom) :
    # the goal is to give a weighted average that expresses the visual 
    #  separation between two glyphs when they are placed so their bounding 
    #  boxes are adjacent. The separation between two rectangles would be 0 
    #  While the separation between "T" and "o" would be fairly large 
    # The trick is to guess a good weighting function. My guess is that 
    #  things that look close are more important than those which look far 
    #  So "T" and "O" should be dominated by the crossbar of the "T"...
    #
    # Find the area the two glyphs have in common (so when comparing "o" and
    #  "l" or "g", ignore the ascenders and descenders since that's outside
    #  the range of "o" and won't affect its visual proximity.
    imin_y = max(onRight.iminY,onLeft.iminY);
    imax_y = min(onRight.imaxY,onLeft.imaxY);
    #
    # Some glyph combinations will have no overlap -- the grave accent and the
    # letter "a" will have none. So they don't interact visually.
    if imax_y &lt; imin_y :
	return( 0 )
    #
    # Otherwise compute some sort of weighted average of the separations between
    # the two glyphs at various heights.
    tot,cnt = 0,0
    j = imin_y
    while j&lt;=imax_y :
	if onRight.left[j] &lt; 32767 and onLeft.right[j] &gt; -32767 :
	    # beware of gaps such as those in "i" or "aaccute" 
	    # a gap has a left or right value which is huge
	    # so ignore any such, again it doesn't contribute to the
	    # visual separation.
	    sep = onRight.left[j] - onLeft.right[j]
	    weight = 1.0/(sep + denom)
	    weight *= weight
	    tot += weight*sep
	    cnt += weight
	j += 1
    if cnt!=0 :
	tot /= cnt
    return( int(round( tot )) );

fontforge.registerGlyphSeparationHook(GlyphSeparation)
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  The hook will be called with three arguments, a structure with information
  about the glyph on the left, a structure with information about the glyph
  on the right, and a floating point number which contains a small number which
  varies with the em-size of the font (currently it will be 1/50th).
  <P>
  I don't pass a standard glyph object, because I preprocess it to get certain
  important information. The underlying glyph object can be obtained through
  the <CODE>glyph</CODE> member. The most important things in the structure
  are two arrays, one representing the x offset between the left side of the
  bounding box and the leftmost contour at a given height (this will always
  be non-negative) called <CODE>left</CODE>, and the other being the x offset
  betweeen the right side of the bounding box and the rightmost contour at
  a given height (this will always be non-positive) called <CODE>right</CODE>.
  The array rThe glyph structures contain the following members:
  <TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING="2">
    <TR>
      <TD>glyph</TD>
      <TD>This is the standard python glyph object. This can (rarely) be None.</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD>boundingbox</TD>
      <TD>A tuple of 4 values (minx,miny,maxx,maxy) for the glyph</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD>iminY</TD>
      <TD>The low bound of the arrays.</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD>imaxY</TD>
      <TD>The high bound of the arrays</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD>left</TD>
      <TD>an array of integers representing the separation between the left edge
	of the bounding box and the leftmost contour at that height (never negative)</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD>right</TD>
      <TD>an array of integers representing the separation between the right edge
	of the bounding box and the rightmost contour at that height (never positive)</TD>
    </TR>
  </TABLE>
  <P>
  iminY and imaxY are scaled from the y units in the glyph itself. Generally
  they will be about 1/10th of those units (though this will vary depending
  on the em-size of the font). The value contain at left[0] would represent
  minimum separation between boundingbox.minx and any the x location of any
  contour when the y location was between 0 and 10. Similarly left[1] would
  be the minimum separation with the y location between 10 and 20. And so forth.
  <P>
  Some glyphs, like "i" will have gaps -- in the hole between the dotlessi
  and the dot. In this case the left array will have a value of 32767 to mark
  the hole, and the right array a value of -32767.
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE>    imin_y = max(onRight.iminY,onLeft.iminY);
    imax_y = min(onRight.imaxY,onLeft.imaxY);
    if imax_y &lt; imin_y :
	return( 0 )
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  Here we figure out the range along the y axis where the glyphs both exist.
  If the two glyphs don't share any area along the y axis (as, for example,
  the glyph "a" and the grave accent might not) then we assume they do not
  interact and return a visual separation of 0.
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE>    tot,cnt = 0,0
    j = imin_y
    while j&lt;=imax_y :
	if onRight.left[j] &lt; 32767 and onLeft.right[j] &gt; -32767 :
	    sep = onRight.left[j] - onLeft.right[j]
	    weight = 1.0/(sep + denom)
	    weight *= weight
	    tot += weight*sep
	    cnt += weight
	j += 1
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  Otherwise loop over the y range where both glyphs are active. Checking to
  make sure there are no holes.
  <P>
  We find the actual separation between the two glyphs at this y value.
  <P>
  Then we calculate some magic weighting function (this is handwaving. your
  routine will have a better weighting function)
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE>    if cnt!=0 :
	tot /= cnt
    return( int(round( tot )) );
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  And finally we take the weighted average of those separations, and return
  that as the optical separation.
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE>fontforge.registerGlyphSeparationHook(GlyphSeparation)
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  And this routine will tell FontForge to use the hook you provide.
