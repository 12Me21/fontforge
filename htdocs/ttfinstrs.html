<P>
I shall not attempt to describe the mechanics of instructing truetype, if
you want to understand it I refer you to the above links.
(<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OTSPEC/ttinst.htm">Microsoft
has a similar set </A>in but they are in word format).
<P>
This dialog shows the instructions associated with a glyph or truetype table
(like fpgm or prep). If you move your mouse cursor over one of the instructions
a brief help message will pop up describing that instruction. If you press
the [Edit] button the dlg will change and you will be presented with a editable
textarea containing the same instructions. You may modify these to your heart's
content. Pressing the [Parse] will parse your modifications and (if they
parse) return you to the "help" mode.
<P>
Instructions like MIRP may be entered either in PfaEdit's peculiar (but
marginally more mnemonic) style: <CODE>MIRP[rnd,white] </CODE>or as
<CODE>MIRP[00110]</CODE>, and <CODE>PUSHB_1</CODE> may be
<CODE>PUSHB[000]</CODE>.
<P>
You may also include an stack arguments on the same line as the instruction
and PfaEdit will convert them into the appropriate pushes. So...
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>5 SRP0
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
is equivalent to
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>PUSHB_1
5
SRP0
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
You may also use the expression <CODE>cvt(&lt;val&gt;)</CODE> instead of
a number. This will be replaced by the index in the 'cvt ' table of an entry
which is (within one em-unit of) &lt;val&gt;. So <CODE>cvt(100)</CODE> would
return the index in 'cvt ' of 100.
