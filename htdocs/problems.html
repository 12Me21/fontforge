  Finding common font problems automagically
</H1>
<P>
Nobody is perfect.
<P>
Well, I'm not.
<P>
When you draw you characters you are likely to make some minor errors, like
having stems with slightly different widths in different characters, or having
lines which aren't quite vertical or...
<P>
PfaEdit's Find Problems command can help track down some common errors. In
some cases it will be able to fix things for you, but it won't do so without
your permission (who knows, some of the so-called "problems" might actually
be what you wanted), but it will point things out to you that you should
look at.
<P>
This command works either in the font view, the outline view or the metrics
view. In the font view it will examine all selected characters for errors,
and if it finds anything open a window looking at the character and post
a (non-modal) dialog saying what the error is. You may then correct the problem
and press the [Next] button in the dialog when you are done, or you may stop
the command with the [Stop] button. Some errors PfaEdit will be able to fix
automagically, and if so there will be a [Fix] button in this dlg
(<FONT COLOR="Red"><SMALL><STRONG>NOTE</STRONG></SMALL></FONT>: You should
not assume that all problems are in fact errors. Some "problems" may be intended
peculiarities of the font design. Don't just blindly press the [Fix] button).
Behavior in the outline and metrics views is similar, except that only one
character is searched for problems.
<P>
PfaEdit will be able to check for more problems if you:
<UL>
  <LI>
    AutoHint the font first
  <LI>
    Bring up the <A HREF="fontinfo.html#Private">Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;Private
    </A>sub-dialog, add entries for BlueValues, StdHW and StdVW and press the
    [Guess] button for each of them
</UL>
<P>
Note: Some of these problems are geared specifically to the problems of
Latin/Greek/Cyrillic fonts. I would be happy to hear of ways to extend these
to other script systems, or of problems that are specific to other script
systems
(<A HREF="mailto:pfaedit-users@lists.sourceforge.net">pfaedit-users@lists.sourceforge.net</A>).
<P>
<IMG SRC="findprobs.png" WIDTH="307" HEIGHT="431" ALIGN="Right">PfaEdit can
detect the following potential problems:
<P>
<STRONG><BIG>Points Too Close</BIG></STRONG>
<P>
Some of PfaEdit's own commands get confused by tiny splines, on the order
of one unit or less, and anyway if you have several points very close together
it is unlikely that they will make a detectable difference when the font
is printed. Probably you should remove one of them... If PfaEdit detects
two points on the same path which it deems to be too close it will select
both, stop and let you fix things.
<P>
<STRONG><BIG>X near [val]</BIG></STRONG>
<P>
Often there will be a set of features which should be consistant across the
entire file. For example the left side-bearing of the characters "BDEFHIKLMNPR"
should perhaps all be the same. This will let you enter in the desired
side-bearing value, and then PfaEdit will find all characters with points
that are near, but not exactly on the desired value. Where "near" is defined
at the bottom of the dialog (in this case, everything within 3 units -- in
either direction -- will be near). If it finds an errant point, PfaEdit will
select it, stop and let you fix it.
<P>
<STRONG><BIG>Y near [val]</BIG></STRONG>
<P>
This is the exact counter-part of the above command except for being in the
Y direction. Often times this check is more efficiently done by the following
check...
<P>
<STRONG><BIG>Y near standard heights</BIG></STRONG>
<P>
In Latin, Greek and Cyrillic alphabets there are certain standard heights
that PfaEdit expects to find: the baseline, the height of lower case letters,
the height of capital letters, the height of lower case letters with ascenders
(often the same as, or very close to, the capital height), and the depth
of lower case letters with descenders. For this command PfaEdit defines these
heights to be 0, the height of "x", the height of "I", the height of "l"
and the depth of "p" (If you are working on a Greek or Cyrillic font and
don't include the Latin alphabet, PfaEdit will pick similar letters from
your alphabet). Then PfaEdit will search for any points which are "near",
but not on, these heights. Again where "near" is defined at the bottom of
the dialog. If it finds such a point, PfaEdit will select it, stop and let
you fix things.
<P>
<STRONG><BIG>Control points near horizontal/vertical/italic</BIG></STRONG>
<P>
This is similar to the <A HREF="problems.html">Edges near Horizontal option</A>
below, but where that only looks for straight lines, this one looks for curved
lines that begin or end near horizontal (vertical, italic angle).
<P>
<STRONG><BIG>Control points beyond
spline</BIG></STRONG><IMG SRC="cpodd.png" WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="215" ALIGN="Right">
<P>
Consider the character at right, the selected point has a control point that
is far outside of what is reasonable and is probably not where it should
be. This will check for such points.
<P>
Technically it will search for all control points, which when projected onto
the line between the two end points of the spline lie outside of the segment
between the two.
<P>
<STRONG><BIG>Irrelevant control points</BIG></STRONG>
<P>
This will look for control points which are so close to the point they modify
that they are unlikely to affect the shape of the curve. A control point
is deemed too close if the distance between it and its modified point is
less than the "Irrelevant Factor" times the distance between the two end
points of the spline controlled by this control point.<BR Clear=Right>
<P>
<IMG SRC="findprobs-paths.png" WIDTH="307" HEIGHT="431" ALIGN="Right"><STRONG><BIG>Open
Paths</BIG></STRONG>
<P>
All of your paths should be closed, that is they shouldn't have any end points
the way a line segment does, but should connect back to their beginning.
This is often caused by being a little careless with the last point on a
path, and instead of joining it to the first, you just put it near the first.
If PfaEdit detects any open paths it will select the entire path, and stop
to let you fix things up.
<P>
<STRONG><BIG>Edges near horizontal/vertical/italic</BIG></STRONG>
<P>
It is very easy to create a line which is almost, but not quite, vertical.
This will check for that situation. And for horizontal, and (if your font
has an italic angle) for lines which are almost but not quite parallel to
the italic angle. If it finds one of these, PfaEdit will select the two end
points, stop and let you fix things.
<P>
For horizontal lines it will tell you the y coordinates of the two end-points,
for vertical lines it will show you the x coordinates.
<P>
<BIG><STRONG>Path Direction</STRONG></BIG>
<P>
Both PostScript and TrueType require that paths be traced in a clockwise
fashion. This sometimes doesn't matter, but many rasterizers do a better
job if this rule is obeyed. This command will detect whether this constraint
is violated.
<P>
Currently the command will report the same error several times if you do
not fix the problem. That's sort of a bug, but I don't see an easy way around
it yet.
<H3>
  <STRONG>More Points Than</STRONG>
</H3>
<P>
Appendix B of the PostScript Language Reference manual says that an interpreter
is only required to support paths with 1500 points on them. Most interpreters
actually have a much higher limit, so you may change the limit to suit your
desires. I believe that control points are included in the count. Note that
when checking a quadratic font (ie. a truetype font) there will be at most
one control point between any two end points, but when that font gets converted
to PostScript there will be two. PfaEdit currently counts this as one point).
TrueType has no such limit.<BR Clear=all>
<H3>
  <STRONG><IMG SRC="findprobs-refs.png" WIDTH="307" HEIGHT="431" ALIGN="Right">Flipped
  References</STRONG>
</H3>
<P>
As mentioned above both PostScript and TrueType like clockwise paths. If
you have a flipped reference then either the reference or the original character
will be drawn with a counter-clockwise path. To fix it you should
Edit-&gt;Unlink the reference and Element-&gt;Correct Direction
<H3>
  <STRONG>Refs Deeper Than</STRONG>
</H3>
<P>
Appendix B of the the
<A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/pdfs/tn/5177.Type2.pdf">Type2</A>
spec says that an interpreter is only required to support subroutine nesting
up to 10 levels. PfaEdit uses subroutine calls to handle referenced characters
and sometimes also to handle hinting. Hinting will take up a maximum of 1
level of subroutine calls leaving 9 available for references. TrueType has
no such limit.<BR Clear=all>
<P>
<BIG><STRONG><IMG SRC="findprobs-hint.png" WIDTH="307" HEIGHT="431" ALIGN="Right">Hints
controlling no points</STRONG></BIG>
<P>
This is a bit esoteric, and is present to provide a work-around for (what
I think is) a bug in ghostview. Consider the following character
<P>
<IMG SRC="phi-nohints-outline.png" WIDTH="89" HEIGHT="151">
<IMG SRC="phi-nohints-filled.png" WIDTH="93" HEIGHT="121">
<IMG SRC="phi-hints-outline.png" WIDTH="72" HEIGHT="133">
<IMG SRC="phi-hints-filled.png" WIDTH="93" HEIGHT="125"><BR>
The first two images show the character with no hints, first as seen in PfaEdit,
then as displayed by ghostview. The result looks good. If we add hints to
the two curved stems then ghostview gets very confused. I don't know enough
about hints to know whether there should be hints there. I am assuming so,
which is why PfaEdit will generate them. But this command will detect this
problem if in fact it is a problem. If PfaEdit finds this it will select
the offending hint and allow you to fix things (probably the best fix is
to add curved points at the extrema of all the curved splines, this is actually
recommended by adobe anyway
(<A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/pdfs/tn/T1_Spec.pdf">T1_Spec.pdf
</A>section 4.1)).
<P>
<STRONG><BIG>Points near hint edges</BIG></STRONG>
<P>
If you have a character like "H" where the main vertical stems are broken
by the cross bar, it is all too easy to make the top part of the stem a slightly
different width than the bottom. (The hinting process figures out all the
stems.) So this command, in essence, is looking for points which are slightly
off from a stem. (again, near is defined at the bottom of the dlg). If PfaEdit
finds such a point it selects it, stops, and allows you to fix it up.
<P>
<BIG><STRONG>Hint width near [val]</STRONG></BIG>
<P>
Usually one wants many of the characters to have a constant stem width, and
this command will check that all stems near the indicated value are that
value (again near is defined at the bottom of the page). If PfaEdit finds
a bad stem it will select it, stop and allow you to fix things.
<P>
<BIG><STRONG>Almost stem3 hint</STRONG></BIG>
<P>
Postscript has a special hint operator (hstem3 and vstem3) which is designed
to hint the stems of things like "m" where there are three stems of equal
width and equally far appart. It is easy for a character not to fit the criteria
for this operator (which means PfaEdit won't use it). This will detect cases
that are close to right. I found that I needed to adjust the "Near" value
to be bigger than the default.
<P>
<STRONG><BIG>Show exact stem3</BIG></STRONG>
<P>
(this is not a problem, but I found it helpful to be able to distinuish between
cases where the "almost stem3" above didn't say anything. It might be because
it was a stem3 or it might be really far off from a stem3)
<H3>
  <STRONG>More Hints Than</STRONG>
</H3>
<P>
Appendix B of the the
<A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/pdfs/tn/5177.Type2.pdf">Type2</A>
spec says that an interpreter is only required to support a total of 96
horizontal and vertical hints.
<H3>
  <IMG SRC="findprobs-random.png" WIDTH="307" HEIGHT="431" ALIGN="Right"><STRONG>Missing
  Bitmaps</STRONG>
</H3>
<P>
Look through the associated bitmap fonts, and find if there is a bitmap font
which is missing versions of characters present in the outline font. Conversely
look for bitmap fonts with characters which are not present in the outline
font.
<P>
<STRONG><BIG><A NAME="Advance">Check Advance</A></BIG></STRONG>
<P>
Check for any characters whose advance width is not the specified value (useful
for a mono-space font where you want to check that all characters have the
same width).
<P>
<STRONG><BIG>Check Vertical Advance</BIG></STRONG>
<P>
Check for any characters whose vertical advance (for fonts with vertical
metrics) differs from the specified value.
<P>
<STRONG><BIG>Check substitutions for empty chars</BIG></STRONG>
<P>
Looks through all the 'GSUB' substitution, alternate substitution, multiple
substitution and ligature entries that are attached to the current character
and checks to make sure that all the named components are present in the
font (and contain something). <BR Clear=ALL>
<P>
<IMG SRC="findprobs-att.png" WIDTH="307" HEIGHT="431" ALIGN="Right"><BIG><STRONG>Missing
Glyph Names</STRONG></BIG>
<P>
It is possible to create a substitution, ligature, etc. which refers to a
glyph name that is not in the font. This option will check for the above
error.
<P>
<STRONG><BIG>Missing Lookup Tags</BIG></STRONG>
<P>
It is possible to create a contextual feature which refers to a lookup tag
which does not exist in the font. This option will check for that error.
<P>
  <HR Clear=all>
<P>
<IMG SRC="findprobs-cid.png" WIDTH="301" HEIGHT="418" ALIGN="Right">If your
font is a CID keyed font you will also get:
<P>
<STRONG><BIG>Check for CIDs defined twice</BIG></STRONG>
<P>
Looks through the font set to see if there are any CIDs which have valid
glyphs in two or more fonts.
<P>
<STRONG><BIG>Check for undefined CIDs</BIG></STRONG>
<P>
Looks for CIDs which have no glyphs defined for them in any font. This is
a fairly common occurance in CID fonts, so use this with caution.<BR Clear=all>
<P>
At the bottom of the dialog are two buttons (<CODE>[Clear All]</CODE> and
<CODE>[Set All]</CODE> which will, respectively, clear and set the check
boxes for all tests -- Well, CID tests will not be set by <CODE>[Set
All]</CODE> in non cid-keyed fonts).
<P>
There is also a text field which allows you to define the meaning of "Near"
as used in various of these tests. The default value is that things are "near"
if they are within 3 em-units of the desired value and not equal to that
value.
