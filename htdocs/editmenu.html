<DL>
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Undo">Undo</A>
  <DD>
    This command is not available in the font view.
    <P>
    In the outline view and the bitmap view this will undo the last command.
    Up to twelve commands may be undone (after that they get thrown away)
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Redo">Redo</A>
  <DD>
    This command is not available in the font view.
    <P>
    In the outline view and the bitmap view this will redo the last command undone.
    Up to twelve commands may be redone (after that they get thrown away)
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Cut">Cut</A>
  <DD>
    In the font view this command puts the foreground of all selected characters
    into the clipboard and then deletes them. Depending on the setting of
    <A HREF="#From">Copy From</A> it will either refer all characters (bitmap
    and outline) corresponding to this entry, or just the character being displayed.
    <P>
    In the Outline View this will copy any selected points, References, or Images
    into the clipboard and then delete them. If a point is removed from a path
    then the path will be broken at there, see the <A HREF="#Merge">Merge</A>
    command for information on how to leave the path whole but without the point.
    (if there is no selection nothing happens)
    <P>
    In the Bitmap View this will copy the selection into the clipboard and then
    delete it. If there is no selection nothing happens.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Copy">Copy</A>
  <DD>
    In the font view this command puts the foreground of all selected characters
    into the clipboard. Depending on the setting of <A HREF="#From">Copy From</A>
    it will either refer all characters (bitmap and outline) corresponding to
    this entry, or just the character being displayed.
    <P>
    In the Outline View this will copy any selected points, References, or Images
    into the clipboard. If there is no selection everything will go into the
    clipboard.
    <P>
    In the Bitmap View this will copy the selection into the clipboard, if there
    is no selection everything is copied.
  <DT>
    Copy <A NAME="Reference">Reference</A>
  <DD>
    In the font view this command puts a reference to all selected characters
    into the clipboard.
    <P>
    In the Outline View this will copy a reference to the current character into
    the clipboard (only available in foreground mode).
    <P>
    This command is not available in the Bitmap View.
  <DT>
    Copy <A NAME="Width">Width</A>
  <DD>
    In the Font View this command copies the widths of all selected characters
    and stores them in the clipboard.
    <P>
    In the Outline View this command copies the width of the current character
    and stores it in the clipboard.
    <P>
    This command is not available in the Bitmap View.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Paste">Paste</A>
  <DD>
    In the Font View this command will paste whatever is in the clipboard into
    the foregrounds of all selected characters (exception: if the clipboard contains
    an image it will not go into the foreground). If there are more selected
    characters than there is information in the clipboard then the clipboard
    will be repeated until all selected characters have had something pasted
    in them (that is if characters A and B were selected when the copy happened
    and now characters C, D and E are selected, the C will get A, D will get
    B and E will also get A). If the clipboard contains outline information then
    that information will go into the character outline regardless of the setting
    of Copy From. If the clipboard contains a bitmap and the display is set to
    outline then the bitmap is pasted into the bitmap font it was copied from
    (ie. the one with the same pixel size), if the clipboard contains a bitmap
    and the display is set to a bitmap then the bitmap will be pasted into the
    currently displayed font.
    <P>
    In the Outline View this command will paste whatever is in the clipboard
    to the current editing layer.
    <P>
    In the Bitmap View this command will flatten any floating selection and paste
    the contents of the clipboard into a new floating selection.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Clear">Clear</A>
  <DD>
    Similar to <A HREF="#Cut">Cut</A> except it does not copy anything to the
    clipboard.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Merge">Merge</A>
  <DD>
    This command is only available in the Outline View. If a point on a path
    is selected, the the merge command will remove that point from the path and
    join the two points around the removed one with a new spline which approximates
    the curve between the two before.
  <DT>
    Select <A NAME="All">All</A>
  <DD>
    Should be self explanatory.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Unlink">Unlink</A> Reference
  <DD>
    Only available in the Outline View and only when in the foreground layer.
    This will remove a referenced character and replace it with the splines and
    points that make it up.
  <DT>
    Copy <A NAME="From">From</A>
  <DD>
    Only available in the Font View.
    <DL>
      <DT>
	All <A NAME="Fonts">Fonts</A>
      <DD>
	If this is set then Copy (and Cut and Clear) will copy from the outline font
	and from all the bitmap fonts
      <DT>
	<A NAME="Displayed">Displayed</A> Font
      <DD>
	If this is set then Copy will only copy from the font currently being displayed.
    </DL>
    <P>
    This also controls the behavior of the
    <A HREF="elementmenu.html#Transform">Transform</A> and
    <A HREF="elementmenu.html#Accented">Build Accented</A> character commands.
