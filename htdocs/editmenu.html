<DL>
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Undo">Undo</A>
  <DD>
    In the outline view and the bitmap view this will undo the last command.
    The number of commands that may be undone for any glyph is controlled by
    the <A HREF="prefs.html#UndoDepth">UndoDepth</A> preference item.<BR>
    In the font and metrics views, this does NOT undo the last command. It undoes
    the last operation on all selected characters.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Redo">Redo</A>
  <DD>
    In the outline view and the bitmap view this will redo the last command undone.
    Up to twelve commands may be redone (after that they get thrown away)<BR>
    In the font and metrics views, this does NOT undo the last command. It undoes
    the last operation on all selected characters.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Cut">Cut</A>
  <DD>
    In the font view this command puts the foreground of all selected characters
    into the clipboard and then deletes them. Depending on the setting of
    <A HREF="#From">Copy From</A> it will either refer all characters (bitmap
    and outline) corresponding to this entry, or just the character being displayed.
    <P>
    In the Outline View this will copy any selected points, References, or Images
    into the clipboard and then delete them. If a point is removed from a path
    then the path will be broken at there, see the <A HREF="#Merge">Merge</A>
    command for information on how to leave the path whole but without the point.
    (if there is no selection nothing happens)
    <P>
    In the Bitmap View this will copy the selection into the clipboard and then
    delete it. If there is no selection nothing happens.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Copy">Copy</A>
  <DD>
    In the font view this command puts the foreground and hints of all selected
    characters into the clipboard. Depending on the setting of <A HREF="#From">Copy
    From</A> it will either copy all glyphs (bitmap and outline) corresponding
    to this entry, or just the glyph being displayed. Normally it will not copy
    a character's name, but if <A HREF="#CharName">Copy From-&gt;Char Name</A>
    is set then it will copy the name as well.
    <P>
    In the Outline View this will copy any selected points, References, or Images
    into the clipboard. If there is no selection everything in the current layer
    will go into the clipboard.
    <P>
    In the Bitmap View this will copy the selection into the clipboard, if there
    is no selection everything is copied.
    <P>
    To external applications selected points (and associated contours) will be
    exported to the clipboard with format "image/eps", while a selected image
    will be exported with formats "image/png" and "image/bmp". If you Copy a
    series of characters into the clipboard, the only the first one will be exported
    to external applications. If the clipboard contains a single point, then
    this will also be exported in STRING format (giving the coordinates of the
    point); the intent is to make it easier to people to identify the point.
    See the section on <A HREF="selections.html">selections</A>
  <DT>
    Copy <A NAME="Reference">Reference</A>
  <DD>
    In the font view this command puts a reference to all selected characters
    into the clipboard.
    <P>
    In the Outline View this will copy a reference to the current character into
    the clipboard (only available in foreground mode).
    <P>
    This command is not available in the Bitmap View.
  <DT>
    Copy <A NAME="Width">Width</A>
  <DD>
    In the Font View this command copies the widths of all selected characters
    and stores them in the clipboard.
    <P>
    In the Outline View this command copies the width of the current character
    and stores it in the clipboard.
    <P>
    This command is not available in the Bitmap View.
  <DT>
    Copy <A NAME="VWidth">VWidth</A>
  <DD>
    In the Font View this command copies the vertical widths of all selected
    characters and stores them in the clipboard.
    <P>
    In the Outline View this command copies the vertical width of the current
    character and stores it in the clipboard.
    <P>
    This command is not available in the Bitmap View.
  <DT>
    Copy <A NAME="LBearing">LBearing</A>
  <DD>
    In the Font View this command copies the left side bearings of all selected
    characters and stores them in the clipboard.
    <P>
    In the Outline View this command copies the left side bearing of the current
    character and stores it in the clipboard.
    <P>
    This command is not available in the Bitmap View.
  <DT>
    Copy <A NAME="RBearing">RBearing</A>
  <DD>
    In the Font View this command copies the right side bearings of all selected
    characters and stores them in the clipboard.
    <P>
    In the Outline View this command copies the right side bearing of the current
    character and stores it in the clipboard.
    <P>
    This command is not available in the Bitmap View.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="CopyGridFit">Copy Grid Fit</A>
  <DD>
    Only available in the outline character view and only if
    <A HREF="viewmenu.html#ShowGridFit">View-&gt;Show Grid Fit </A>is selected.
    This will place a copy of the grid fit version of the character into the
    clipboard.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Paste">Paste</A>
  <DD>
    In the Font View this command will paste whatever is in the clipboard into
    the foregrounds of all selected characters (exception: if the clipboard contains
    an image it will not go into the foreground), clearing out whatever was there.
    If there are more selected characters than there is information in the clipboard
    then the clipboard will be repeated until all selected characters have had
    something pasted in them (that is if characters A and B were selected when
    the copy happened and now characters C, D and E are selected, the C will
    get A, D will get B and E will also get A). If exactly one character is selected
    but the clipboard contains more that one character, the the selection will
    be extended so that enough characters are selected that something may be
    pasted in each. <BR>
    If the clipboard contains outline information then that information will
    go into the character outline regardless of the setting of Copy From. If
    the clipboard contains a bitmap and the display is set to outline then the
    bitmap is pasted into the bitmap font it was copied from (ie. the one with
    the same pixel size), if the clipboard contains a bitmap and the display
    is set to a bitmap then the bitmap will be pasted into the currently displayed
    font. If the clipboard contains a bitmap of a size which does not exist in
    our database, then you will be asked if you want to create a bitmap font
    to put the bitmap into.
    <P>
    In the Outline View this command will paste whatever is in the clipboard
    to the current editing layer.
    <P>
    In the Bitmap View this command will flatten any floating selection and paste
    the contents of the clipboard into a new floating selection.
    <P>
    If the clipboard is owned by an external application PfaEdit will attempt
    to Paste the following selection types (the bitmap view does not currently
    respond to external clipboards):
    <TABLE BORDER>
      <TR>
	<TD>"image/png", "image/bmp"</TD>
	<TD>background images</TD>
      </TR>
      <TR>
	<TD>"image/eps"</TD>
	<TD>as spline data</TD>
      </TR>
    </TABLE>
    <P>
    See the section on <A HREF="selections.html">selections</A>
  <DT>
    <A NAME="PasteInto">Paste Into</A>
  <DD>
    Only available in the fontview. Just like Paste, except it does not clear
    the contents of the character before adding to it.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="SameGlyphAs">Same Glyph As</A>
  <DD>
    Only available in the fontview. If the clipboard contains a single reference
    to a glyph then applying this command makes all selected encoding points
    refer to that same glyph. (For example the non-breaking-space character (U+00A0)
    frequently uses the same glyph as the space character. To accomplish this,
    select the space character, Copy Ref, select the non-breaking-space character
    and Same Glyph As).
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Clear">Clear</A>
  <DD>
    Similar to <A HREF="#Cut">Cut</A> except it does not copy anything to the
    clipboard.
  <DT>
    Clear <A NAME="Background">Background</A>
  <DD>
    Only in the font view. This command clears the backgrounds of all selected
    characters.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Merge">Merge</A>
  <DD>
    This command is only available in the Outline View. If a point on a path
    is selected, the the merge command will remove that point from the path and
    join the two points around the removed one with a new spline which approximates
    the curve between the two before. This command comes in two forms, in the
    default case the two surrounding points will retain their slopes (unless
    both are corner points), while in the other case (Elide)
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Join">Join</A>
  <DD>
    This command is not available in the bitmap view. It looks for any paths
    with endpoints as the endpoints of other paths and then join those two paths.
    Also if the endpoint of a path is the same as the start point it will make
    that path into a loop. (The commands that move points around will normally
    do this automatically, but Paste will not).<BR>
    In the Outline view things are slightly more complicated: If any paths have
    selected points on them it will only attempt to join those paths.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Elide">Elide</A>
  <DD>
    This is a varient of the Merge command, obtained by holding down the shift
    key when bringing down the menu (or by Ctl-Alt-M). Allows the slopes of points
    to change.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="CopyFg">Copy Fg To Bg</A>
  <DD>
    This command is only available in the Outline and Font Views. It cleans out
    all the splines in the background layer and replaces them with a copy of
    all the splines in the foreground layer. Note: Any background images remain.
    No references are copied.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Select">Select</A>
  <DD>
    In the outline view there is a select menu, other views just have Select
    All.
    <DL>
      <DT>
	Select <A NAME="All">All</A>
      <DD>
	In the outline view it selects all points, all references (all images if
	the background is active) and the width line (and the vertical width line
	if that is enabled). In the fontview it selects all characters. In the bitmap
	view it selects the current bitmap region.
      <DT>
	<A NAME="Deselect">Deselect</A> All
      <DD>
	Deselects anything selected
      <DT>
	<A NAME="FirstPt">First Point</A>
      <DD>
	Deselects everything and then selects the first point on the first path of
	the character.
      <DT>
	<A NAME="NextP">Next</A> Point
      <DD>
	Deselects the current point and selects the next point.
      <DT>
	<A NAME="PrevP">Prev</A> Point
      <DD>
	Deselects the current point and selects the previous point
      <DT>
	<A NAME="NextCP">Next</A> Control Point
      <DD>
	Selects the "Next Control Point" of the current point.
      <DT>
	<A NAME="PrevCP">Prev</A> Control Point
      <DD>
	Selects the "Prev Control Point" of the current point.
      <DT>
	(De)<A NAME="SelWidth">Select</A> Width
      <DD>
	Toggles whether the width line is selected.
      <DT>
	<A NAME="SelVWidth">(De)Select</A> VWidth
      <DD>
	(if vertical metrics are enabled) Toggles whether the vertical width line
	is selected.
      <DT>
	Select <A NAME="Color">Color</A>&gt;
      <DD>
	Only in the font view. Displays a submenu containing a list of colors and
	allows you to select all characters which you have set to that color with
	the Char Info dlg. Normally the selection is cleared before setting the colored
	characters, but if you hold down the shift key the selection will be extended
	to the colored characters.
      <DT>
	<A NAME="SelectByATT">Select By ATT...</A>
      <DD>
	Only in the font view. Brings up a <A HREF="selectbyatt.html">dlg</A> which
	allows you to select various characters depending on various advanced typographic
	features.
    </DL>
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Find">Find</A> / Replace
  <DD>
    Only in the font view, this brings up a <A HREF="search.html">dialog</A>
    that allows you to find patterns within characters and replace them with
    other patterns.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Unlink">Unlink</A> Reference
  <DD>
    This will remove a referenced character and replace it with the splines and
    points that make it up.
  <DT>
    Copy <A NAME="From">From</A>
  <DD>
    Only available in the Font View.
    <DL>
      <DT>
	All <A NAME="Fonts">Fonts</A>
      <DD>
	If this is set then Copy (and Cut and Clear) will copy from the outline font
	and from all the bitmap fonts
      <DT>
	<A NAME="Displayed">Displayed</A> Font
      <DD>
	If this is set then Copy will only copy from the font currently being displayed.
      <DT>
	<A NAME="CharName">Char Metadata</A>
      <DD>
	Normally Copy does not copy the metadata (name, unicode encoding, comment,
	ligature info) associated with a character, but if this is checked then it
	will.
    </DL>
    <P>
    This also controls the behavior of the
    <A HREF="elementmenu.html#Transform">Transform</A> and
    <A HREF="elementmenu.html#Accented">Build Accented</A> character commands.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Remove-Undoes">Remove Undoes</A>
  <DD>
    Not available in the Metrics View. This allows you to free up some of the
    memory PfaEdit is currently squandering on keeping track of Undoes (and Redoes).
    Obviously this command cannot be undone.
    <UL>
      <LI>
	In the Outline Character view this will free up all undoes/redoes in the
	current edit mode
      <LI>
	In the Bitmap Character view this will free up all bitmap undoes/redoes
      <LI>
	In the Font View this will free up all undoes/redoes in all selected characters,
	outline and bitmap, background and foreground.
