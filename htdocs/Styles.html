  The Style sub-menu provides a series of dialogs which allow you to create
  some common stylistic variations of latin fonts.

    <LI>
      Stems and their widths<BR>
      Modification of a Stem's width makes the font appear Bolder or Lighter
    <LI>
      Counters and their widths (a counter is the white space between stems)<BR>
      Modification of a Counter's width makes the font appear Expanded or Condensed
    <LI>
      Left and Right Side Bearings<BR>
      Behavior similar to Counter's
  </UL>
  <P>
  The results will probably always need to be examined and fixed up by the
  human eye, but they may provide a help in changing a font's attributes.
  <P>
  It "works" best on sans serif, non-Oblique fonts. 
    <HR>
  <H3>
    Bold
  </H3>
  <P>
  Bold fonts have thicker stems and are slightly more extended than normal
  fonts. In Knuth's Computers &amp; Typesetting, the bold fonts have a stem
  width that is approximately 1.6 (1.68(at 12pt)-1.5(at 5pt)) times the stem
  width of the normal font. This is very similar to the 1.75 suggested by
  Microsoft's ratio of 700/400 (700 being the numeric weight of a bold font,
  and 400 being the numeric weight of a normal font).
  <P>
  In Knuth's Computer Modern Bold Extended Roman, the "m" glyph is extended
  to 1.15 times the width of the "m" in Computer Modern Roman, and the x-height
  is 1.03 times higher.

    Point Size

  <P>
  At first glance this does not seem like much of a transformation, after all
  postscript and truetype fonts can be drawn at any pointsize. But traditionally,
  as the point-size decreases the boldness (thickness of the stems) increases
  slightly, the counters and side bearings also change. For metal type there
  were generally three drawings for a glyph in a given font, one for pointsizes
  less than 10, one for pointsizes 10,11 and 12, and one for display sizes
  (above 12). Most computer vector fonts do not show this change, while Knuth's
  Computer Modern fonts have a continuum:

  To the left is an example of the same word (taken from a font specimen sheet)
  printed at 3 different point sizes (8,12 and 24) and then scaled up to the
  same size. The most obvious difference is that the glyphs are proportionally
  wider at the smaller pointsizes. It is less apparent that the stems of the
  letters are different:

    The <A NAME="Embolden">Change</A> Weight
    dialog<IMG SRC="ChangeWeight.png" WIDTH="332" HEIGHT="281" ALIGN="Right">
  </H3>
  <P>
  The Change Weight dialog starts out by stroking the glyph (Element-&gt;Expand
  Stroke) and removing the internal contour. This means that each stem in the
  glyph will now be wider by the number of em units specified at the top of
  the dialog. Of course, this number may be negative, in which case you will
  be making a lighter, rather than a bolder variant of the glyph.
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="BoldHiraDA.png" WIDTH="270" HEIGHT="270" ALIGN="Left">For CJK fonts,
  with complex shapes but without the constraint of the latin baseline and
  cap height, this expansion is probably enough. The image at right shows the
  Hiragana DA syllable -- the original glyph shape is in the background, and
  the expanded shape is in the foreground.<BR Clear=All>
  <P>
  However if we do that to a latin (or Greek, or Cyrillic) glyph the result
  is rather odd because the glyph no longer rests on the baseline, and also
  extends above the cap-height (or x-height, or whatever line bounds this
  particular glyph).

  <P>
  The radio buttons let you choose which method to use. CJK simply expands
  the glyph and leaves it at that. LCG expands the glyph and then forces it
  between the baseline and caps/x-height. Auto will chose which of those methods
  to apply. Custom will basically use the LCG method but allows you to specify,
  manually, what the interesting regions are in this particular glyph.

  a hint which surrounds "Top Hint" it will also be moved down. (Points on

  will not be expanded to an inappropriate size.

  Any other points will be interpolated between the points which move (rather
  like the TrueType IUP instruction -- indeed, the process of making a glyph
  bolder is very like instructing a glyph).

  <P>
  And for the counters, &lt;&gt; Squish will result in the small counters that

  <P>
  If the font has and Italic Angle specified in Font Info, then fontforge will
  first unskew the glyph in the hopes of getting some vertical stems, then
