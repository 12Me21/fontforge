Wacom graphics tablets and PfaEdit
</H1>
<P>
I have added support to PfaEdit for the wacom graphics tablet. Eventually I will
write some drawing tools that depend on pressure (and tilt perhaps).
<P>
To install a wacom tablet on your (linux) machine you must do two things:
<UL>
<LI>Install a kernel module "wacom.o" into your system<BR>
Unfortunately the module which ships with linux (Nov 2002) does not work but John Joganic has
<A HREF="http://linux.joganic.com/wacom/">an execelent website</A> that will help you install
a working driver.
<LI>Install an X11 driver "wacom_drv.o"<BR>
Unfortunately this really doesn't work and I know no working version anywhere.
</UL>
<P>
Therefore I have hacked a little mini-driver into PfaEdit. Since the configure
script can't detect that you have a non-working X11 driver on your machine (or a tablet) you
must configure this option by hand. So after the normal configure script has run (and before typing make):
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
$ su
# chmod 644 /dev/input/event0
# ^D
$ cd gdraw
$ vi Makefile
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Add <CODE>gdrawwacomdriver.lo</CODE> to the list of <CODE>libgdraw_OBJECTS</CODE> And add <CODE>-D_WACOM_DRV_BROKEN</CODE> to <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE>.
