</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="sidebearings.png" WIDTH="111" HEIGHT="191" ALIGN="Right">After
you have created the shapes of your characters you must next figure out the
spacing between characters. The space between any two character has two
components, the space after the first character, and the space before the
second character. In a left to right world these two are called the right
side bearing and the left side bearing respectively.
<P>
The left side bearing may be changed by the simple expedient of
<CODE>Edit-&gt;Select All</CODE> (in the outline view) and then dragging
the selected objects to the appropriate place. The right side bearing may
be changed by selecting the advance width line and adjusting it
appropriately.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>
However it is generally better not to set the metrics of a single character
in isolation, you should see the character in the context of other characters
and set it from that perspective. Use the <CODE>File-&gt;Open
<A HREF="metricsview.html">Metrics Window </A></CODE>command.<BR>
<IMG SRC="MetricsView.png" WIDTH="478" HEIGHT="323"><BR>
Any characters selected in the fontview (when you invoke the metrics view)
will be displayed in the metrics view. You may change which characters are
displayed by either typing new ones in to the text field at the top of the
view, or by dragging a character from the fontview.
<P>
From here you may adjust any character's metrics by typing into the textfields
below it, or you may select a character (by clicking on its image) and drag
it around (to adjust the left side bearing), or drag its width line (to adjust
its right side bearing).
<P>
If you want to generate a "typewriter" style font (where all characters have
the same width) execute an <CODE>Edit-&gt;Select All</CODE> from the fontview
and then <CODE>Metrics-&gt;Set Width</CODE>. This will set the widths of
all characters to the same value. After doing that you might also want to
execute <CODE>Metrics-&gt;Center in Width</CODE> to set the even out the
left and right spacing on each character.
<P>
<I><IMG SRC="autowidth.png" WIDTH="276" HEIGHT="268" ALIGN="Right"></I>If
all this manual operation seems too complicated, try
<CODE><A HREF="autowidth.html#AutoWidth">Metrics-&gt;Auto Width</A></CODE>.
This will automagically assign widths to characters. These widths are not
up to professional standards, but they are generally reasonable approximations.
<H3>
  <A NAME="Vertical">Vertical</A> Metrics
</H3>
<P>
PfaEdit provides some support for the vertical metrics needed for CJK fonts.
First you must tell PfaEdit that this font should contain vertical metrics,
do this with <CODE>Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;General-&gt;Has Vertical
Metrics</CODE>. Then in each outline character enable VMetrics in the Layers
palette.
<P>
You should now see a vertical advance line somewhere underneath your character.
You may drag this line just as you would the horizontal advance (width) line.
<H2>
  <A NAME="Kerning">Kerning</A>
</H2>
<P>
If you are careful in setting the left and right side-bearings you can design
your font so that the spacing looks nice in almost all cases. But there are
always some cases which confound simple solutions.
<P>
Consider "<FONT FACE="helvetica">To</FONT>" or
"<FONT FACE="helvetica">Av</FONT>" here the standard choices are inappropriate.
The "<FONT FACE="helvetica">o</FONT>" will look better if it can slide more
to the left and snuggle under the top bar of the
"<FONT FACE="helvetica">T</FONT>". This is called kerning, and it is used
to control inter-character spacing on a pair-by-pair basis.
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING="2">
  <CAPTION>
    Kerning
  </CAPTION>
  <TR>
    <TD><IMG SRC="To-unkerned.png" WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="323"></TD>
    <TD><IMG SRC="To-kerned.png" WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="323"></TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
In the above example the left image shows the unkerned text, the right shows
the kerned text. To create a kerned pair, simply click on the right character
of the pair, the line (normally the horizontal advance) between the two should
go green (and becomes the kerned advance). Drag this line around until the
spacing looks nice.
<P>
(Some character combinations are better treated by
<A HREF="editexample4.html#ligature">creating a ligature </A>than by kerning
the letters)
<H3>
  Kerning classes
</H3>
<P>
If you have many characters which have similar kerning features you might
instead wish to create a set of <A HREF="metricsview.html#kernclass">kerning
classes</A> (which might say that A, &Agrave;, &Aacute;, &Acirc;, &Acirc;,
&Atilde; and &Auml; all kern alike).
<H3>
  Vertical Kerning
</H3>
<P>
PfaEdit does not support vertical kerning.
