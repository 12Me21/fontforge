  PfaEdit on Mac OS/X

  Building PfaEdit
</H2>
<P>
Before you do anything you must get a copy of the Mac Developer Tools. You can
get this <A HREF="http://connect.apple.com/">from Apple</A> (you can either download
a 250Meg file, or pay them $20 to FedEx you a CD.
<P>
Then you must install X11. <A HREF="http://www.osxgnu.org/">The GNU Mac OS/X site
contains a complete X11 package</A>, probably other sites do too.
<P>
Neat. <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11/download/">Now Apple is also distributing X11</A>.
<P>
It is possible to build PfaEdit without X11. There will be no user interface, but
you can run scripts.
<P>
Thirdly you may choose to install some image libraries (I recommend at least
installing libpng). Currently PfaEdit only tries to link statically with these
libraries.
    <UL>
      <LI>
	<A HREF="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html">libpng</A> (and required
	helper <A HREF="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/">zlib</A>)
      <LI>
	<A HREF="http://www.libtiff.org/">libtiff</A>
      <LI>
	<A HREF="http://prtr-13.ucsc.edu/~badger/software/libungif/index.shtml">libungif</A>
      <LI>
	<A HREF="http://www.ijg.org/">libjpeg</A>
    </UL>
<P>
Finally you are ready to build pfaedit. Download the most recent sources <A HREF="index.html#source">from this site.</A>
then:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>$ gunzip pfaedit_full-*.tgz
$ tar xf pfaedit_full-*.tar
$ cd pfaedit
$ configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>
  Installing the Mac OS/X <A NAME="binary">binary</A> distribution
</H2>
<P>
Before installing PfaEdit you should ensure that you have X windows up and
running. This is free software available from <A HREF="http://www.osxgnu.org/">the GNU Mac OS/X site</A>.
(Or you can download the package built without X, which has no user interface but
will let you run scripts).
<P>
After that you should just be able to unpack the packages provided.
<UL>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="PfaEdit-030109.pkg.sit">Download pfaedit Mac OS/X executable
    </A>Version: 9-Dec-2003
  <LI>
    <A HREF="PfaEdit-NoX-021205.pkg.sit">Download pfaedit Mac OS/X WITHOUT
    X11</A> Version: 05-Dec-2002<BR>
    You might want this version if you aren't interested in downloading X onto
    your machine.<BR>
    Without X11 you will have no user interface, but you can run scripts.
  <LI>
    On older versions of Mac OS/X the packages above will not install.
    So I'm including <A HREF="pfaedit_MacOSX-030109.tgz">
</UL>
<P>
These packages install into /usr/local/bin. You may need to add that to your
PATH environment variable, and do something similar for MANPATH:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>$ vi ~/.cshrc
setenv PATH /usr/local/bin:$PATH
setenv MANPATH /usr/local/share/man:$MANPATH
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
If your shell is bash
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>$ vi ~/.bashrc
PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH ; export PATH
MANPATH=/usr/local/share/man:$MANPATH ; export MANPATH
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>
  <A NAME="Running">Running</A> PfaEdit on Mac OS/X
</H2>
<P>
The X server (XDarwin) must be running before PfaEdit can start. XDarwin
lives in the Applications folder and may be started by double clicking on
it.
<P>
You may start PfaEdit either from an xterm or from a Terminal window. If
you start it from a Terminal window you must first type:<BR>
$ setenv DISPLAY :0
<P>
The default window manager (twm) doesn't work well with PfaEdit when X is
running in rootless mode.
<P>
PfaEdit allows the window manager to position its windows for it, and twm
does this by allowing the user to click anywhere on the screen to position
the upper left corner of the new window. Unfortunately unless X has a window
under the location where you want the upper left corner to be Aqua will put
X into the background and steal the click from X.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>You can only open a window if you position it so
that it's upper left corner is on one of X's already existing
windows.</STRONG></FONT>
