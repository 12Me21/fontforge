  Building FontForge
</H2>
<P>
Before you do anything you must get a copy of the Mac Developer Tools. These
now ship with each new mac (on the CD labeled XCode), it is optional software,
you must explicitly install it, or you can get this
<A HREF="http://connect.apple.com/">from Apple</A> (you can either download
a 250Meg file, or pay them $20 to FedEx you a CD.
<P>
Then you must install X11. Again it ships with new macs, again it must be
explicitly installed. You need to install two X packages. The first is X11User
on the third install CD, the second is X11SDK on the XCode CD.
<P>
It is possible to build FontForge without X11. There will be no user interface,
but you can run scripts.
<P>
Thirdly you may choose to install some image libraries (I recommend at least
installing libpng). Currently FontForge only tries to link statically with
these libraries.

    (see the <A HREF="index.html#Dependencies">dependencies</A> entry for a more
    complete list)
</UL>
<P>
Finally you are ready to build fontforge. Download the most recent sources
<A HREF="index.html#source">from this site.</A> then:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>$ gunzip fontforge_full-*.tgz
$ tar xf fontforge_full-*.tar
$ cd fontforge
$ configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>
  Installing the Mac OS/X <A NAME="binary">binary</A> distribution
</H2>
<P>
Before installing FontForge you should ensure that you have X windows up
and running. Apple now ships this with new Macs, but it is optional software
(CD 3) and you must explicitly request it by customizing your install. You
can also get this <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11/download/">from
apple</A>, or from <A HREF="http://www.osxgnu.org/">the GNU Mac OS/X site</A>.
(Or you can download the package built without X, which has no user interface
but will let you run scripts).
<P>
After that you should just be able to unpack the packages provided.
<UL>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="FontForge-20040808.pkg.sitx">Download fontforge Mac OS/X executable
    </A>Version: 08-Aug-2004<BR>
    (if you can't unstuff the sitx format, download a new version of stuffit
    expander from
    <A HREF="http://www.aladdinsys.com/downloads/software.html">http://www.aladdinsys.com/downloads/software.html)</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="PfaEdit-NoX-021205.pkg.sit">Download fontforge Mac OS/X WITHOUT
    X11</A> Version: 05-Dec-2002 (a year and more out of date)<BR>
    You might want this version if you aren't interested in downloading X onto
    your machine.<BR>
    Without X11 you will have no user interface, but you can run scripts.
</UL>
<P>
These packages install into /usr/local/bin. You may need to add that to your
PATH environment variable, and do something similar for MANPATH:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>$ vi ~/.cshrc
setenv PATH /usr/local/bin:$PATH
setenv MANPATH /usr/local/share/man:$MANPATH
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
If your shell is bash
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>$ vi ~/.bashrc
PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH ; export PATH
MANPATH=/usr/local/share/man:$MANPATH ; export MANPATH
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
See the <A HREF="index.html#Dependencies">dependencies</A> section for external
libraries/programs you may want to add to your system to enhance FontForge's
capabilities.
<H2>
  <A NAME="Running">Running</A> FontForge on Mac OS/X
</H2>
<P>
The X server (XDarwin) must be running before FontForge can start. XDarwin
lives in the Applications folder and may be started by double clicking on
it.
<P>
You may start FontForge either from an xterm or from a Terminal window. If
you start it from a Terminal window you must first type:<BR>
$ setenv DISPLAY :0
<P>
The default window manager (twm) doesn't work well with FontForge when X
is running in rootless mode.
<P>
FontForge allows the window manager to position its windows for it, and twm
does this by allowing the user to click anywhere on the screen to position
the upper left corner of the new window. Unfortunately unless X has a window
under the location where you want the upper left corner to be Aqua will put
X into the background and steal the click from X.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>You can only open a window if you position it so
that it's upper left corner is on one of X's already existing
windows.</STRONG></FONT>
