With the appropriate <A NAME="image-libs">libraries</A>, PfaEdit can import
png, tiff, and gif images to act as character backgrounds for tracing purposes
(PfaEdit can import bmp and xbm formats without external libraries). With
the freetype library PfaEdit will do a better job making bitmap characters
for you. None is required for the proper compilation/execution of PfaEdit,
if the libraries are not present they will not be used. If your machine doesn't
have them and you want them they are available from:

</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>
    16-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Created a "Select" submenu of the edit menu in the outline view. Moved
	Edit-&gt;Select All, View-&gt;Next Point, View-&gt;Prev Point into it.
      <LI>
	Added Deselect All, Select Next Control Point, Select Prev Control Point,
	Select First Point, Select Width, Select VWidth
      <LI>
	It is now possible to select the width (right bearing) line and move it with
	the arrow keys or transform dlg (or to move points and the width line
	concurrently). VWidth too.
      <LI>
	Added variables with global and font scope to Scripting.
      <LI>
	Yet another bug in the new simplify/merge code
      <LI>
	Cleaned up unicode range names a bit more.
	  <HR>
      <LI>
	Changed the Goto Character dialog so that it will now (for two/four byte
	encodings) display a list of unicode ranges which are in the font and allow
	you to go to a range by name.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    14-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	My TrueType parser will now read cmap subtable formats 8,10 and 12 (the 4
	byte encoding tables) and will produce format 12 subtables for full unicode
	fonts.
      <LI>
	Cleaned up various encoding problems.
      <LI>
	Fixed display of SJIS.
      <LI>
	Added better commentary on unicode outside of BMP
      <LI>
	Cleaned up the spec file
      <LI>
	In pfb files subroutines for references didn't work if the first thing called
	was untranslated.
      <LI>
	The arrow keys can be used to move a control point.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    12-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Added sjis and Wansung encodings
      <LI>
	Used freetype for a couple of other things (generating gdf files and exporting
	bitmaps)
      <LI>
	Textfields didn't respond to middle button clicks (to paste the primary
	selection).
      <LI>
	PfaEdit would sometimes fail to exit properly if you brought up a script
	dlg.
      <LI>
	Added a --version command line option.
      <LI>
	Fixed another bug in generating postscript.
      <LI>
	Added a user defined print command option to the print dlg.
      <LI>
	Fixed a bug in Simplify/Merge
      <LI>
	Fixed a bug in loading integer resources
      <LI>
	Cleaned up the help command line option.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    9-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit will now use freetype (if available) to generate bitmaps for the
	fonts (results are much better).<BR>
	It still does its own rasterizing for the fontview (there's a lot of overhead
	involved with freetype, and this needs to be fastish)
      <LI>
	Made the Generate Font dlg settings sticky across invocations of pfaedit.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    8-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit would crash when generating a PostScript font from ARIAL.TTF.
      <LI>
	Changed the bitmap dlgs so that they allow you to specify some control over
	interesting screen resolutions. (before just support X standard res. of 75
	and 100, now support MS 96&amp;120 and Mac 72).
      <LI>
	Oops, Apple now documents that the bdat and bloc tables should have version
	number 0x20000. But when I last looked it said 0x10000 and that didn't work.
      <LI>
	Put the docs in their own rpm file.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    7-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	I think I've figured out how Apple does asian bitmaps now. They don't use
	NFNTs at all (or they do, but those NFNT are tiny stubs with no real data
	in them). All the data are in the sfnt. I should produce them properly now.<BR>
	-- Except I don't.
      <LI>
	I've also added the ability to create bitmap only sfnts for the mac.<BR>
	-- Which also isn't recognized by the mac.
      <LI>
	Made it possible for scripts to generate bitmaps without generating an outline
	font
      <LI>
	Fixed some problems loading bitmaps from ttf files.
      <LI>
	Fixed some problems loading bitmaps from anything...
      <LI>
	Allowed importation of eps files from the font view (to the extent that I
	can parse eps files, that is)
      <LI>
	Oops, scripting didn't support importation of pcf files.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    5-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Sometimes popup windows (tool tips) would show up with nothing in them. That
	should be fixed now.
      <LI>
	Added icons for pcf files
      <LI>
	Started work on 32 bit unicode.
      <LI>
	Oops. Scripting handled the caligraphic pen angle incorrectly.
      <LI>
	Put something into the about box.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    4-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Oops. PfaEdit was misusing the type1 "seac" command in some cases. I had
	not realized that the character being built needed to have the same width
	as the base (non-accent) character. This has been fixed.
      <LI>
	When using the charinfo dlg to change the name of a char, and that name was
	in use, and you cancelled the dlg after being warned about it then PfaEdit
	would crash (it would muck up memory).
      <LI>
	PfaEdit wasn't always calling subroutines (in postscript) when a character
	was in a subr.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit will now read in X11 pcf font files (they can be compressed, if so
	PfaEdit will decompress them first).
      <LI>
	Bug in wildcard processing for file chooser window.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    1-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Nifty! SUSE ships some greek (bitmap) fonts with iso8859-1 encodings rather
	than iso8859-7. PfaEdit is now alert and when it sees a bitmap font with
	foundary "greek" and encoding "iso8859-1" it will pretend it has encoding
	"iso8859-7".
      <LI>
	PfaEdit got confused by some fonts produced by type1fix.pl. Should be fixed.
      <LI>
	Build Composit Characters will now check the user defined ligature string
	to see what characters to use to build a ligature.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    31-Jan-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Conversion tables between JIS0201 (Katakana) and Unicode were wrong. KANOU
	Hiroki provided correct ones.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    30-Jan-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Oops. I'd left diagonal stems enabled in ttf generation. Caused problems.
	Disabled now.
      <LI>
	More work on accented characters.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    29-Jan-2002
    <UL>

      <LI>
	Added a menu of commonly used scripts which the user can specify with the
	preference dlg.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    25-Jan-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Oops. Generate command in scripting language only generated pfb fonts
      <LI>
	PfaEdit would get confused if it loaded a font from a script when running
	with windows. Eventually it would crash, but perhaps not until you exited.
      <LI>
	Added
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    $italicangle
	  <LI>
	    $cidfontname, $cidfamilyname, $cidfullname

	call to a script file easily
    </UL>
  <LI>
    24-Jan-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Added a way to scale dlgs in different languages.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    23-Jan-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Fixed a crash in merge (caused by selecting all points on a path and merging
	it (to remove the path))
      <LI>

	Added a Set Width command to the bitmap view IF there is no outline font.
      <LI>
	Added a menu item to invoke a script
      <LI>
	Added a "Comment" field to FontInfo. This does not correspond to any postscript
	or truetype entity. It is to be used for a changelog within the sfd file
	(or something similar).
    </UL>
  <LI>
    19-Jan-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Initial version of <A HREF="scripting.html">scripting</A>.

    <UL>
      <LI>

	a window was destroyed.
      <LI>

      <LI>
	Bug in the new TTF hinting routines could cause a crash (and did cause glyph

    should always be acceptable)

    Importing a type0 font loses the encoding. PfaEdit only imports simple type0

    After adding the Johab encoding, any old fonts which had a unicode encoding
    will suddenly claim to have a Johab encoding. I don't see a way around this
    at the moment. Just reencode them as unicode and all should be well.
  <LI>
    When reading in TrueType PfaEdit will not get the correct offset for composit
    glyphs where offsets are specified by point matching rather than as x,y values.
    (some mac fonts)
  <LI>
    My truetype hinting is still bad. Especially for diagonals.
  <LI>
    Some truetype fonts (kaiu and mingliu) do not store the correct outline.
    Instead they rely on using the instructions to move points around to generate
    the outline. The outline does not appear to be grid-fit at all, just positioned.
    PfaEdit will not read the instructions. In most fonts this would be the wrong
    thing to do, and I don't know how I could tell when it needs to be done...
  <LI>
    PfaEdit's support for the GPOS table output is limitted. Currently it only
    recognizes latin,cyrillic,greek,arabic and hebrew scripts. It assumes everything
    it doesn't recognize is latin. It makes at most two lookup tables for kerning
    one for left to right scripts, one for right to left scripts. If you want
    to work with a different script let me know, and let me know something about
    it. It should be easy enough to add (I hope). Furthermore I don't know what
    to do about digits which appear in arabic/hebrew in l2r ordering, so I shall
    give the r2l scripts access to both lookups.
  <LI>
    I'm told AutoKern doesn't work too well.
  <LI>
    PfaEdit is confused by small splines, on the order of one em unit. If you
    need something that small, scale the font up by a factor of 2 or more (including
    the ascent and descent).
  <LI>
    The MetaFont command doesn't work well.

  Installing it
</H2>

The executable tarball contains the pfaedit executable and a man page. Put
it wherever you'd like.

  Running it
</H2>
<P>
<KBD>$ pfaedit font.pfa font2.pfb font3.sfd font4.ttf font5.otf font6.gsf
font7.bdf</KBD> <BR>
will start pfaedit looking at the fonts you specify on the command line.
It can read either pfb or pfa fonts, and some ps fonts (type 0 fonts based
on a type 1 dictionary) as well as truetype fonts, non-CID open type fonts
and bitmap fonts.<BR>
<KBD>$ pfaedit -new</KBD><BR>
will cause pfaedit to create a new font (in iso-8859-1 encoding)<BR>
<KBD>$ pfaedit</KBD><BR>
will open up a file picker dialog and allow you to browse till you've found
a font file (or have created a new one).
