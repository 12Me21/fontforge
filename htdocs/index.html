<FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>PfaEdit</STRONG></FONT> -- A postscript font editor
that lets you create your own postscript, truetype, opentype, cid-keyed and
bitmap (bdf) fonts, or edit existing ones. Also lets you convert one format
to another.

      <LI>
	The 9 Jan metrics view fix caused crashes when changing the last character
	displayed.
      <LI>
	The outline view now will display points at extrema in a different color
	from other points if you want that.
      <LI>
	Added a command to the font view to clear out the backgrounds of all selected
	characters.
      <LI>
	Fixed one more image freeing problem (see 29-Dec-2001) 
	  <HR>
      <LI>
	bdf fixes of 9&amp;11 Jan did not work on bdf files with character encodings
	of "-1"
      <LI>
	Fixed several bugs with ttf bitmap tables.
      <LI>
	Added a mechanism for specifying a font inside a truetype collection from
	the command line:<BR>
	<CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; $ pfaedit "gulim.ttc(GulimChe)"</CODE><BR>
	will load the GulimChe font within the collection file.

	Russian ui had an unexpected space in it which confused makenomenh. Have
	fixed both (makenomenh &amp; nomen.ru)
      <LI>
	Last fix to Merge made most merges return straight lines
      <LI>
	Added an elide command which allows the slopes of the endpoints to change
      <LI>
	Releasing the control or super key when in one of the palettes did not update

      <LI>
	bdf "fix" of 9 Jan. lost the encoding of the font.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit source included "ushort" in a couple of places. Linux must define
	this but some systems don't. It has been changed to uint16 which I define.
      <LI>
	Worked around some imaging bugs of the X server under cygwin (PfaEdit seems
	to work under cygwin now)
      <LI>
	Using the arrow keys to scroll only worked if something were selected. should
	always work now.
      <LI>
	The fontview now contains an indication of which characters have backgrounds
      <LI>
	Minor improvements to merge when given an impossible problem.

	destroy window fix on 2 Jan was not enough, it popped up again. Hope I've
	killed it this time
      <LI>
	PfaEdit had trouble reading bdf fonts that
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    did not have standard X font names (-vendor-family-weight-italic-...)
	  <LI>
	    had the same name used for different characters
	</UL>
      <LI>
	The metrics view got confused by characters with negative lbearings.
      <LI>
	Added some Japanese (Kanji) text samples.

    8 Jan 2002
    <UL>

	Added a traditional chinese sample
      <LI>
	In the metrics view, the kerning offset was not rescaled when the size of
	the window changed.
      <LI>
	Added a preference item to control the amount by which the arrow keys move
	selected points
      <LI>
	Changed the behavior of the grid layer so that now points will snap to any
	spline in the grid layer, not just horizontal and vertical splines
      <LI>
	Added a preference item to control this snap distance.
      <LI>
	Added a couple new outline display sizes to the fontview
      <LI>
	Use the "super" modifer to simulate a mouses middle button. If the super
	key (the one with a windows flag on it on pc keyboards) is depressed then
	any mouse click will be treated as if it were mouse button 2 that was used.
      <LI>
	Minor improvements in truetype hinting
    </UL>
  <LI>
    4 Jan 2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	if a dfont (or other mac resource file) contains multiple truetype fonts,
	pfaedit will let you pick one (before it would read in the first and ignore
	the others)
      <LI>
	The tools palette now shows the mouse bindings.
      <LI>
	Next/Prev control points are drawn in different colors now, and those colors
	are reflected in the point get info dlg.
      <LI>
	Merge and Simplify will now retain the slope of curve points.
      <LI>
	Simplify will no longer remove points at the extrema of their curves (PostScript
	fonts are supposed to have points at the extrema)
      <LI>
	New command in Element menu to <A HREF="elementmenu.html#Add-Extrema">add
	points at extrema</A> to a spline or set of splines.
      <LI>
	Next/Prev Point commands will shift the screen so the newly selected point
	is visible.
      <LI>
	Metrics View now allows for anti aliased character display.
      <LI>
	Metrics View View menu was broken and was missing half its entries.
      <LI>
	Revert Font would leave pfaedit in a state where some commands would cause
	a crash. Should be fixed now.
      <LI>
	TextFields did not scroll properly with the arrow keys.
      <LI>
	The outline and bitmap views may be scrolled with the arrow keys by holding
	down either the control or meta key.
      <LI>
	When reading a ttf file with an encoding pfaedit doesn't recognize which
	has some glyphs which are refered to from multiple code points, then pfaedit
	used to crash.
      <LI>
	Support Menu key on windows keyboard
      <LI>
	Use the Windows "flag" key as a modifier to indicate mouse button 2 (so if
	that key is depressed, and a mouse button is pressed/released pretend it
	was button2)
    </UL>
  <LI>
    2 Jan 2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Copy From has been made global and sticky (each font used to have a seperate
	value and it got lost on exit. Now there is one global value and it is saved
	in the prefs file).
      <LI>
	Copy From now allows you to control whether a character's name should be
	copied along with the glyph data (only in font view).
      <LI>
	View-&gt;Fill should now show the current setting.
      <LI>
	If there were background images in a glyph then changing the Show/Hide rulers
	made the display wrong
      <LI>
	In the Outline view, the character's popup box would appear if the mouse
	were over the menubar. Werner thought that inappropriate.
      <LI>
	If import bitmaps needed to expand the number of characters in a font (to
	provide slots for all the bitmaps) it would fail to do so properly. Resulting
	in a crash.
      <LI>
	Hmm. There appears to be a race condition inside the XServer on my machine
	and if I map a window but destroy it before I read the MapNotify (or possibly
	Expose) event on the queue, then the server will calmly crash. This can happen
	if a progress indicator is ended just after we decide to display it. I've
	tried to work around it, but there may still be holes.
      <LI>
	Added an "About..." menu entry to display the splash screen again
      <LI>
	Gleep! type1 cid font generation had a couple of problems
      <LI>
	Print Sample is now available for cid fonts.
      <LI>
	View-AntiAlias didn't work (characters were always displayed as antialiased)
      <LI>
	Menus made more responsive to key presses.
      <LI>
	The Zoom In and Out commands are now centered around the selection (if there
	is one, if not they continue to use center of the window)
      <LI>
	Changed the order of entries in the Point Info dlg so that Prev is above
	Next
      <LI>
	The Escape key can be used to deselect
      <LI>
	New copyright notices.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    29-Dec-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	TextFields had numerous display problems. Should have fewer now.
      <LI>
	The 15 Dec image crash fix was not complete, turns out there were two memory
	problems (well, two so far)
      <LI>
	Some dialogs could show up half off the right edge of the screen. Should
	not do so now.
      <LI>
	Added a few more language samples for printing.
      <LI>
	Bidi display didn't work when there were lots of combining letters around
      <LI>
	Bidi printing didn't work when there was more than one line of right to left
	text
      <LI>
	Typing control characters to the fontview will no longer move to that character.
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    Typing [Return] opens selected characters
	  <LI>
	    Typing [Tab] moves to next character with something in it.
	</UL>
      <LI>
	Depressing the right mouse button invokes a popup menu in the fontview now.
      <LI>
	Trying to move a control point with the mouse while simultaniously moving
	the point itself with the arrow keys used to cause a crash
      <LI>
	Selecting a bdf font which was in a bad format as a background caused a crash.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    19-Dec-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	The german ui file should be in better german
      <LI>
	pfaedit would not notice that an iso10646 bdf file was unicode
      <LI>
	Support for conversion to and from some 2 byte encodings (LocalCharset preference
	item)
      <LI>
	sfd files store the font's encoding as a string rather than a number now
	so if we add more standard encodings things won't get screwed up as they
	were when we added johab.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    18-Dec-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	<FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>TrueType hints were terrible</STRONG></FONT>. I
	fixed one huge bug. There are still problems with diagonals and the results
	are not as nice as Fontographer's, but they are better.
      <LI>
	Some more greek fixes.
      <LI>
	Metrics window did not handle the transition from a left -&gt; right view
	to a right-&gt;left one properly (mostly this means if you had a blank metrics
	view and you put a hebrew/arabic character into it then that character was
	displayed left to right).
      <LI>
	The transform dialog in the fontview now has a checkbox which allows you
	to control whether you want the background transformed in sync with the
	foreground.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    17-Dec-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Fixed another bug with cid fonts, this one when attempting to create such
	a font in the absence of cidmap files
      <LI>
	Fixed a bug when outputting otf cid files (bug appeared when I added vertical
	metrics)
      <LI>
	When loading a cid font PfaEdit could get caught up in an semi-infinite loop
	asking for cidmap files. Should be fixed now.
      <LI>
	Finally got rid of the annoying warning about tempnam() when linking.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    16-Dec-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Scrollbars didn't always update in big textfields
      <LI>
	Missed the hot key for unlink reference in the font view.
      <LI>
	Fixed crash when clearing empty character cells
      <LI>
	More greek accent fixes
      <LI>
	changed character popups slightly.
      <LI>
	Added another problem to find problems. Will now check for flipped references
	(=&gt;counter-clockwise paths most of the time)
      <LI>
	Interesting. The EuroFont uses the endchar opcode in way that both the type1
	and type2 docs claim to be illegal (it is not the last thing in the subroutine,
	it is followed by a return). Since EuroFont is from adobe, I presume the
	docs are wrong, so I ignore this error now.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit will be better able to figure out where hints should be active when
	it reads in a postscript font.
      <LI>
	Autohint will no longer find some erroneous hints.
      <LI>
	Autohint will now find the serifs in Nimbus Roman
    </UL>
  <LI>
    15-Dec-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Copying a background image caused a crash at some indeterminate future time
      <LI>
	Made the Help browser configurable
      <LI>
	Changed greek accent processing so that it uses more of the greek accents.
	For reasons known best to themselves, unicode tends to map greek varia to
	grave, oxia to accute, etc.
      <LI>
	More work to make sure the screen fonts are readable
      <LI>
	tabbing into a text field selects all of it.
      <LI>
	autotrace 2.8 has changed its argument conventions. new versions of pfaedit
	will no longer work with autotrace2.7.
      <LI>
	If a menu doesn't fit in its window there is now a way to get at the menu
	items which are offscreen
      <LI>
	Cleaned up the panose (fontinfo) window
      <LI>
	Added names to the private use area of unicode for greek small caps (starting
	at 0xf500)
      <LI>
	Fixed a couple of autohint problems
      <LI>
	Manual hint addition might refuse to add a hint if it didn't like it. It
	should now realize that the user is in charge...
    </UL>
  <LI>
    14-Dec-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Oops Edward Lee points out that I was missing some colons in my eps file
	generation.
      <LI>
	Hot key added for Unlink Reference

	The Greek fixup wasn't working as it should (sometimes would generate two
	characters named "Delta" in pfb files). Should be fixed. Should also be
	controlable by Preference item (ie. you can turn it off if you want to)

	The encoding tables in the cmap are supposed to be ordered by platform and
	mine were not.

      <LI>
	Fixed a crash when generating a truetype font which referenced characters
	with encodings bigger than 65535.
      <LI>
	Added a patch from Ulrich, PfaEdit now reads class based kerning from the

PfaEdit is by no means complete. And probably doesn't work very well. Be
prepared to save frequently and always work on a copy of the original.
<UL>
  <LI>
    No attempt has been made to be efficient.
  <LI>
    No attempt has been made to read truetype instructions (hints)
  <LI>
    No attempt has been made to retain the change-over points for hint substitution.
    PfaEdit will refigure this when it saves the font.
  <LI>
    Many type 3 fonts will not be read in correctly (those generated by pfaedit
    should always be acceptable)
  <LI>
    Importing a type0 font loses the encoding. PfaEdit only imports simple type0
    fonts (such as those made by itself), will get confused if there's more than
    one font with a chars dictionary.

  <LI>
    After adding the Johab encoding, any old fonts which had a unicode encoding
    will suddenly claim to have a Johab encoding. I don't see a way around this
    at the moment. Just reencode them as unicode and all should be well.
  <LI>
    When reading in TrueType PfaEdit will not get the correct offset for composit
    glyphs where offsets are specified by point matching rather than as x,y values.
    (some mac fonts)
  <LI>
    My truetype hinting is still bad. Especially for diagonals.
  <LI>
    Some truetype fonts (kaiu and mingliu) do not store the correct outline.
    Instead they rely on using the instructions to move points around to generate
    the outline. The outline does not appear to be grid-fit at all, just positioned.
    PfaEdit will not read the instructions. In most fonts this would be the wrong
    thing to do, and I don't know how I could tell when it needs to be done...
  <LI>
    PfaEdit's support for the GPOS table output is limitted. Currently it only
    recognizes latin,cyrillic,greek,arabic and hebrew scripts. It assumes everything
    it doesn't recognize is latin. It makes at most two lookup tables for kerning
    one for left to right scripts, one for right to left scripts. If you want
    to work with a different script let me know, and let me know something about
    it. It should be easy enough to add (I hope). Furthermore I don't know what
    to do about digits which appear in arabic/hebrew in l2r ordering, so I shall
    give the r2l scripts access to both lookups.
  <LI>
    My rasterizer will never be as good as adobe's.
  <LI>
    I'm told AutoKern doesn't work too well.
  <LI>
    PfaEdit is confused by small splines, on the order of one em unit. If you
    need something that small, scale the font up by a factor of 2 or more (including
    the ascent and descent).
  <LI>
    The MetaFont command doesn't work well.

  Installing it
</H2>
<P>
The executable tarball contains the pfaedit executable and a man page. Put
it wherever you'd like.
<P>
The build script will do an install to /usr/local/bin if you want it to.
<H2>
  Running it
</H2>
<P>
<KBD>$ pfaedit font.pfa font2.pfb font3.sfd font4.ttf font5.otf font6.bdf</KBD>
<BR>
will start pfaedit looking at the fonts you specify on the command line.
It can read either pfb or pfa fonts, and some ps fonts (type 0 fonts based
on a type 1 dictionary) as well as truetype fonts, non-CID open type fonts
and bitmap fonts.<BR>
<KBD>$ pfaedit -new</KBD><BR>
will cause pfaedit to create a new font (in iso-8859-1 encoding)<BR>
<KBD>$ pfaedit</KBD><BR>
will open up a file picker dialog and allow you to browse till you've found
a font file (or have created a new one).
<H2>
  Reporting <A NAME="bugs">bugs</A>...
</H2>
<P>
I'm sure you'll find some. If you can isolate it and come up with a reproduceable
minimal case, that would be great. The executable has symbols in it so if
you run it in gdb you should be able to get a stack trace... Do what you
can.
