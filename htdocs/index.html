With the appropriate <A NAME="image-libs">libraries</A>, PfaEdit can import
png, tiff, and gif images to act as character backgrounds for tracing purposes
(PfaEdit can import bmp and xbm formats without external libraries). With
the freetype library PfaEdit will do a better job making bitmap characters
for you. None is required for the proper compilation/execution of PfaEdit,
if the libraries are not present they will not be used. If your machine doesn't
have them and you want them they are available from:

interested in the scripting engine (with no user interface), it may be built
on systems without X (the configure script should figure this out).

<UL>
  <LI>
    23-June-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Valek wanted to be able to add comments to characters and to flag characters
	with some visible mark. The <A HREF="getinfo.html#Character">Char Info </A>dlg
	has been extended to do this. The scripting language has been extended to
	allow scripts to set and test these too.
      <LI>
	Added a "foreach selected character in the font" loop.
      <LI>
	Added $selection variable to return the current selection as an array
      <LI>
	Extended the Select() and SelectMore() commands to accept an array as an
	argument (and set the selection to the array).
    </UL>
  <LI>
    22-June-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Yesterday's unicode sprintf change introduced another bug. Fixed
      <LI>
	Valek points out that if you have a bitmap only font and you attempt
	simultaneously to scale it and delete all the bitmaps, then PfaEdit would
	crash. (Same thing would happen if you just removed all the bitmaps).
      <LI>
	Valek provided some additional russian translations.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    21-June-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Ttf fonts seem to be unhappy if they contain a glyph with a single contour
	and a single point on that contour. I don't know why. Output all such as
	spaces.
      <LI>
	Added ability to set the resolution of a bdf font.
      <LI>
	Rearranged preferences.
      <LI>
	Added scripting access to Force-Encoding
      <LI>
	PfaEdit memory allocation optimizations didn't work if sizeof(int *)==8
      <LI>
	Bug in unicode sprintf routine when sizeof(long)==8
      <LI>
	In some cases when reading a ttf font with a (unicode) cmap which assigned
	one glyph to two encodings, and if that glyph happened to be in the
	AdobeStandardEncoding, then when converting to Type1 PfaEdit would create
	a dictionary which recursively seac-ed (invoked) itself. This caused an infinite
	loop in GhostView, and crashed some printers.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    11-June-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	CID fix on 3 June was wrong, it broke all non-CID keyed postscript fonts
	(it did work for CID fonts). Both should work now.
      <LI>
	Added better support for bdf foundries and for bdf copyrights.
      <LI>
	Added a preference item to specify the ttf VendorID (foundry). Used to truncate
	the bdf foundry to 4 characters.
      <LI>
	Small bug fix in print
      <LI>
	Cleaned up bug in scripting ($bitmaps)
    </UL>
  <LI>
    7-June-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Fixed some more CID font problems
      <LI>
	Tweaked behavior of FamilyName/FullName in GetFontInfo dlg.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    6-June-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit now supports greymap strikes in truetype files
      <LI>
	The bitmap editor has been extended to handle greymap (anti-aliased) fonts
      <LI>
	There is no longer a seperate mechanism for generating greymap files from
	the Generate Font dlg, instead they may be added to the font database file
	with the bitmap dlg.
      <LI>
	Added support for vertical metrics in bdf files.
      <LI>
	Fixed some problems in moving the vwidth line in outline character views
      <LI>
	Added some default window positioning code.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    4-June-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Oops, more bug fixes for the new greymap format.
      <LI>
	One more attempt to solve the X Server bug where destroying/unmapping a window
	before its map notify event gets processed causes the X server to crash.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    3-June-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Stopped using my extension to bdf to make it support greymaps and started
	using that supported by freetype (removed the BITSPERPIXEL keyword and added
	an extra argument to the SIZE keyword).
      <LI>
	More fixes for cid fonts
    </UL>
  <LI>
    18-May-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Font Info will prompt user about changing the UniqueID/XUID if the font name
	is changed without changing them.
      <LI>
	Fixed some Mac configuration problems.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    16-May-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit would not compile when trying to used libjpeg as a static library
	(as on Mac OS/X)
      <LI>
	Use psili rather than koronis where appropriate
      <LI>
	It was not possible to select the elipse/star tool from the tools palette.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    14-May-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Made pfaedit work without X (ie. the scripting engine can be linked without
	requiring that X be present. Possibly useful for Mac OS/X, Cygwin) 
	  <HR>
      <LI>
	When showing what a greek accented character will be built from, the character
	info dlg will now show the non-unicode alternate whether or not the characters
	needed exist in the font.
      <LI>
	The Reference Info dlg will now include the unicode value of the referenced
	character
      <LI>
	The positioning of ypogegrammeni with respect to eta was broken (again)
      <LI>
	Some more greek fixes.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    13-May-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Various fixes for greek accented characters
    </UL>
  <LI>
    7-May-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit would crash when attempting to Flatten a CID keyed font (introduced
	16-Apr with the multiple fontview support)
      <LI>
	PfaEdit did not process panose information correctly (broken 21-Jan, comment
	change)
      <LI>
	PfaEdit did not create new ttf names properly when they were for a language
	which had not been used before in the font.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    6-May-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Oops. Adobe describes two naming conventions for ligatures and I only supported
	one of them. I should support the other one now.
      <LI>
	Fixed a number of bugs caused by custom encodings.
      <LI>
	If the selection in the font view contained either "dotlessi" or "dotlessj"
	and the Element menu was pulled down then the dotless characters would be
	created from their dotted varients (you didn't even have to select anything
	from the menu) (broken 24-Feb-2002)
      <LI>
	PfaEdit had trouble reading non-empty ttf glyphs with 0 contours.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit failed to read images from an sfd file without a transparent colour
      <LI>
	Allow parens in familyname in the fontinfo dlg.
      <LI>
	When the width was selected, depressing a mouse button would snap the logical
	pointer location to a random x coordinate (often 0).
      <LI>
	When generating a ttf file from a subfont of a CID keyed font pfaedit would
	crash. This has been fixed.
      <LI>
	When exiting with multiple font views looking at one (changed) font, there
	would be no prompt to save the font.
      <LI>
	Added a <A HREF="search.html">Find/Replace</A> feature
    </UL>
  <LI>
    16-Apr-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	BDF fonts did not mark the missing (.notdef, undefined, etc.) character properly.
      <LI>
	otf fonts had the default and normative widths reversed on output
      <LI>
	Added marginally better support for non-latin ligatures in GPOS/GSUB tables.
      <LI>
	Added support for arabic forms in the GSUB table (ie. we now produce 'init',
	'medi', 'fina', and 'isol' features)
      <LI>
	Build composit should now note whether arabic ligatures are
	&lt;initial&gt;, &lt;final&gt;, &lt;medial&gt; or &lt;isolated&gt;
      <LI>
	It is now possible to have multiple font views looking at one font. I expect
	this will be a rich source of bugs, especially for CID keyed fonts.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    9-Apr-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Under KDE we could get two textfields flashing cursors (thinking they had
	focus) should be fixed.
      <LI>
	Added Undo/Redo to metricsview
      <LI>
	Added Undo/Redo to fontview
      <LI>
	Added Element menu to metricsview
      <LI>
	Added [Fix] button to (some of) Find Problems
    </UL>
  <LI>
    5-Apr-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Applied various patches from KANOU Hiroki
      <LI>
	Changes to metricsview
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    Fixed some minor bugs
	  <LI>
	    Double clicking on a character will open that character
	  <LI>
	    Enabled Copy/(CopyRef/CopyWidth/)Paste but not Cut
	</UL>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit had problems when there were exactly two X resources.
      <LI>
	Made the Point Info dlg wider.
      <LI>
	Improved printing text samples at large point sizes.
      <LI>
	I was generating flex hints incorrectly.
      <LI>
	Extended postscript interpretter slightly to recognize the eps files (called
	"art") produced by fontographer
      <LI>
	Additions to the scripting language
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    CenterInWidth
	  <LI>
	    AutoWidth (from Andreas P&aring;hlsson)
	  <LI>
	    AutoKern
	</UL>
      <LI>
	The Expand Stroke fix for 4-Mar-2001 was too extreme.
      <LI>
	Added a field to Char Info that shows the components out of which this character
	(accented, ligature, hangul sylable, etc.) may be built.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    3-Apr-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Various scrollbar enhancements
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    thumb now has a bigger minimum size
	  <LI>
	    fontview/charview both respond to page up and page down requests
	  <LI>
	    right mouse button may be used to position thumb
	</UL>
      <LI>
	Installed James A. Crippen makefile patch so that distclean reports success
	even if there are no files to clean.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit had problems guessing default ligatures for characters outside of
	BMP.
      <LI>
	In the outline character view, double clicking with one of the point tools
	(curve, corner, tangent, pen) will add a point and then bring up a
	<A HREF="getinfo.html">Point Info</A> dialog
      <LI>
	If you edit in a textfield (so that the mouse pointer vanishes) and then
	tabbed into another text field the mouse pointer would never reappear.
      <LI>
	Merge Fonts left memory in a bad state and would often cause a crash.
      <LI>
	Merge Fonts used a string for a title which was ascii when unicode was expected.
	This could cause strange characters to be displayed.
      <LI>
	More fixes for build accented characters (for inverted breve and Oslash).
    </UL>
  <LI>
    14-Mar-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Nifty. The modifier keys auto-repeat under cygwin (if Control is down one
	gets a series of Press/Release, Press/Release... while normal X just gives

PfaEdit is by no means complete. And probably doesn't work very well. Be
prepared to save frequently and always work on a copy of the original.
<UL>
  <LI>
    No attempt has been made to be efficient.
  <LI>
    No attempt has been made to read truetype instructions (hints)
  <LI>
    No attempt has been made to retain the change-over points for hint substitution.
    PfaEdit will refigure this when it saves the font.
  <LI>
    Many type 3 fonts will not be read in correctly (those generated by pfaedit
    should always be acceptable)
  <LI>
    Importing a type0 font loses the encoding. PfaEdit only imports simple type0
    fonts (such as those made by itself), will get confused if there's more than
    one font with a chars dictionary.
  <LI>
    PfaEdit's support for the GPOS/GSUB/VORG table output is limitted. Other
    advanced opentype tables aren't supported at all.
  <LI>
    PfaEdit's support for Apple's Advanced Typography tables (AAT) is non-existant.

  <LI>
    When reading in TrueType PfaEdit will not get the correct offset for composit
    glyphs where offsets are specified by point matching rather than as x,y values.
    (some mac fonts)
  <LI>
    My truetype hinting is still bad. Especially for diagonals.
  <LI>
    I'm told that the truetype fonts generated by PfaEdit don't work on NT 4.0
    (possibly other versions of NT). I don't know how NT's rasterizer differs
    from Windows'.
  <LI>
    Some truetype fonts (kaiu and mingliu) do not store the correct outline.
    Instead they rely on using the instructions to move points around to generate
    the outline. The outline does not appear to be grid-fit at all, just positioned.
    PfaEdit will not read the instructions. In most fonts this would be the wrong
    thing to do, and I don't know how I could tell when it needs to be done...
  <LI>
    After adding the Johab encoding, any old fonts which had a unicode encoding
    will suddenly claim to have a Johab encoding. I don't see a way around this
    at the moment. Just reencode them as unicode and all should be well.
  <LI>
    I'm told AutoKern doesn't work too well.
  <LI>
    PfaEdit is confused by small splines, on the order of one em unit. If you
    need something that small, scale the font up by a factor of 2 or more (including
    the ascent and descent).
  <LI>
    The MetaFont command doesn't work well.
  <LI>
    On linux boxes the dashed lines representing hints or the outlines of references
    get screwed up. I think this is a bug in the XServer on linux (it doesn't
    happen on other systems) but I have not examined it closely.
  <LI>
    PfaEdit will not copy and paste large (&gt;XServer transfer (4Meg on my machine))
    clipboards of text.

  Installing it

it wherever you'd like.

<H2>
  Running it
</H2>
<P>
<KBD>$ pfaedit font.pfa font2.pfb font3.sfd font4.ttf font5.otf font6.gsf
font7.bdf</KBD> <BR>
will start pfaedit looking at the fonts you specify on the command line.
It can read either pfb or pfa fonts, and some ps fonts (type 0 fonts based
on a type 1 dictionary) as well as truetype fonts, non-CID open type fonts
and bitmap fonts.<BR>
<KBD>$ pfaedit -new</KBD><BR>
will cause pfaedit to create a new font (in iso-8859-1 encoding)<BR>
<KBD>$ pfaedit</KBD><BR>
will open up a file picker dialog and allow you to browse till you've found
a font file (or have created a new one).

I'm sure you'll find some. If you can isolate it and come up with a reproduceable

you run it in gdb you should be able to get a stack trace... Do what you
can.
