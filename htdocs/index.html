With the appropriate <A NAME="image-libs">libraries</A>, PfaEdit can import
png, tiff, and gif images to act as character backgrounds for tracing purposes
(PfaEdit can import bmp and xbm formats without external libraries). With
the freetype library PfaEdit will do a better job making bitmap characters
for you. None is required for the proper compilation/execution of PfaEdit,
if the libraries are not present they will not be used. If your machine doesn't
have them and you want them they are available from:

    ???
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Nifty. The modifier keys auto-repeat under cygwin (if Control is down one
	gets a series of Press/Release, Press/Release... while normal X just gives
	one Press.) This meant we'd keep refreshing the tools palette, which meant
	an annoying flicker and slowed things down.
      <LI>
	Raise the palettes after a resize
      <LI>
	PfaEdit didn't handle 8bit colormaps well. I've improved the behavior, and
	added an x resource to give the user some control over behavior.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    10-Mar-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Oops. I broke CID-keyed postscript input (ie. none-otf) when I added the
	6-Mar fix for type1utils
      <LI>
	Applied another patch from KANOU Hiroki, on otf cid support
    </UL>
  <LI>
    9-Mar-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	added docs for sfddiff.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    8-Mar-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Added a new program, <A HREF="sfddiff.html">sfddiff</A>, to compare fonts
	and show their differences.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    6-Mar-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Small change to the format of cidmap files (to bring names into conformance
	with adobe's spec on modifed unicode names), and corresponding changes to
	a few routines.
      <LI>
	Add support for the type1 format produced by GNU type1utils. Which is vaguely
	like that used by ghostview.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    4-Mar-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Fixed more problems with reading eps files (these were mostly within Expand
	Stroke, so presumably also problems with Element-&gt;Expand Stroke)
      <LI>
	And one more problem with the file chooser.
      <LI>
	Scripting additions:
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    Ability to generate a pfm file from script
	  <LI>
	    Ability to Merge Kerning Info from a script
	  <LI>
	    Ability to Remove All Kerning info from a script
	</UL>
      <LI>
	  <HR>
	Will now display something useful for rotated and italic cids
    </UL>
  <LI>
    3-Mar-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Fixed a number of problems involved in reading in eps files.
      <LI>
	28-Feb Mac work introduced a bug in the file picker dlg (in wildcarding).
    </UL>
  <LI>
    2-Mar-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Rounding errors could accumulate when generating Type1 fonts.
      <LI>
	Fix for some overlap problems due to KANOU Hiroki
      <LI>
	If PfaEdit crashed (or was interrupted) after making some (unsaved) changes
	to a font, and that font was subsequently deleted, the PfaEdit's autorecovery
	would complain about a missing file each time it was started. Now it will
	notice the problem and ask whether it should delete the recovery file (whereupon
	it will stop complaining).
      <LI>
	Enabled a fix from Greg Ford so that PfaEdit set the mac style bits
	appropriately.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    28-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	When running under Mac OS/X PfaEdit is now able to open/create mac resource
	forks
      <LI>
	I may have fixed a bug displaying images on solaris screens with bit depth
	8
      <LI>
	Cleaned up a problem with the postscript name table (in a ttf file) when
	there was a .notdef character
      <LI>
	Fixed some problems with references when reading in truetype.
    </UL>
  <LI>

	    font)
	  <LI>
	    BitmapsAvail()
	  <LI>
	    BitmapsRegen()
	</UL>
      <LI>
	Changed the FontInfo dlg to give direct access to the postscript names rather
	than trying to build the fontname out of family and modifiers.
      <LI>
	Added the ability to create an encoding which is any given plane of unicode
	(ie BMP is plane 0, SMP is plane 1, SIP is plane 2...)
      <LI>
	Fixed a bug in Revert
      <LI>
	More work on hints. 
	  <HR>
      <LI>
	Build Composit will now build a dotlessi from an "i" (and same for dotlessj)
    </UL>

      <LI>
	Some linear splines were not noticed as such.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    18-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Cancelling the Point Info dlg would leave minimum distance hints in a bad
	state.
      <LI>
	Using Undo also left the MD hints wonky
      <LI>
	added $fontchanged to scripting
      <LI>
	Added SaveAll menu item in font view.
      <LI>
	Sometimes the underlines for accelerators didn't print in the menu (depended
	on what PfaEdit thought the screen resolution was).
      <LI>
	Added a new minimum distance hint for serifs of diagonal stems.
      <LI>
	Fixed a bug where some extra serif stems were hinted.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    16-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Created a "Select" submenu of the edit menu in the outline view. Moved
	Edit-&gt;Select All, View-&gt;Next Point, View-&gt;Prev Point into it.
      <LI>
	Added Deselect All, Select Next Control Point, Select Prev Control Point,
	Select First Point, Select Width, Select VWidth
      <LI>
	It is now possible to select the width (right bearing) line and move it with

	concurrently). VWidth too.
      <LI>
	Added variables with global and font scope to Scripting.
      <LI>
	Yet another bug in the new simplify/merge code
      <LI>
	Cleaned up unicode range names a bit more. 
	  <HR>
      <LI>
	Changed the Goto Character dialog so that it will now (for two/four byte
	encodings) display a list of unicode ranges which are in the font and allow
	you to go to a range by name.
      <LI>
	Made it possible to copy and paste the left and right side bearings (from
	menus and scripts)
    </UL>
  <LI>
    14-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	My TrueType parser will now read cmap subtable formats 8,10 and 12 (the 4
	byte encoding tables) and will produce format 12 subtables for full unicode
	fonts.
      <LI>
	Cleaned up various encoding problems.
      <LI>
	Fixed display of SJIS.
      <LI>
	Added better commentary on unicode outside of BMP
      <LI>
	Cleaned up the spec file
      <LI>
	In pfb files subroutines for references didn't work if the first thing called
	was untranslated.
      <LI>
	The arrow keys can be used to move a control point.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    12-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Added sjis and Wansung encodings
      <LI>
	Used freetype for a couple of other things (generating gdf files and exporting
	bitmaps)
      <LI>
	Textfields didn't respond to middle button clicks (to paste the primary
	selection).
      <LI>
	PfaEdit would sometimes fail to exit properly if you brought up a script
	dlg.
      <LI>
	Added a --version command line option.
      <LI>
	Fixed another bug in generating postscript.
      <LI>
	Added a user defined print command option to the print dlg.
      <LI>
	Fixed a bug in Simplify/Merge
      <LI>
	Fixed a bug in loading integer resources
      <LI>
	Cleaned up the help command line option.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    9-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit will now use freetype (if available) to generate bitmaps for the
	fonts (results are much better).<BR>
	It still does its own rasterizing for the fontview (there's a lot of overhead
	involved with freetype, and this needs to be fastish)
      <LI>
	Made the Generate Font dlg settings sticky across invocations of pfaedit.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    8-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit would crash when generating a PostScript font from ARIAL.TTF.
      <LI>
	Changed the bitmap dlgs so that they allow you to specify some control over
	interesting screen resolutions. (before just support X standard res. of 75
	and 100, now support MS 96&amp;120 and Mac 72).
      <LI>
	Oops, Apple now documents that the bdat and bloc tables should have version
	number 0x20000. But when I last looked it said 0x10000 and that didn't work.
      <LI>
	Put the docs in their own rpm file.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    7-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	I think I've figured out how Apple does asian bitmaps now. They don't use
	NFNTs at all (or they do, but those NFNT are tiny stubs with no real data
	in them). All the data are in the sfnt. I should produce them properly now.<BR>
	-- Except I don't.
      <LI>
	I've also added the ability to create bitmap only sfnts for the mac.<BR>
	-- Which also isn't recognized by the mac.
      <LI>
	Made it possible for scripts to generate bitmaps without generating an outline
	font
      <LI>
	Fixed some problems loading bitmaps from ttf files.
      <LI>
	Fixed some problems loading bitmaps from anything...
      <LI>
	Allowed importation of eps files from the font view (to the extent that I
	can parse eps files, that is)
      <LI>
	Oops, scripting didn't support importation of pcf files.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    5-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Sometimes popup windows (tool tips) would show up with nothing in them. That
	should be fixed now.
      <LI>
	Added icons for pcf files
      <LI>
	Started work on 32 bit unicode.
      <LI>
	Oops. Scripting handled the caligraphic pen angle incorrectly.
      <LI>
	Put something into the about box.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    4-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Oops. PfaEdit was misusing the type1 "seac" command in some cases. I had
	not realized that the character being built needed to have the same width
	as the base (non-accent) character. This has been fixed.
      <LI>
	When using the charinfo dlg to change the name of a char, and that name was
	in use, and you cancelled the dlg after being warned about it then PfaEdit
	would crash (it would muck up memory).
      <LI>
	PfaEdit wasn't always calling subroutines (in postscript) when a character

    No attempt has been made to be efficient.

    No attempt has been made to read truetype instructions (hints)

    No attempt has been made to retain the change-over points for hint substitution.
    PfaEdit will refigure this when it saves the font.
  <LI>
    Many type 3 fonts will not be read in correctly (those generated by pfaedit
    should always be acceptable)
  <LI>
    Importing a type0 font loses the encoding. PfaEdit only imports simple type0
    fonts (such as those made by itself), will get confused if there's more than
    one font with a chars dictionary.

    After adding the Johab encoding, any old fonts which had a unicode encoding
    will suddenly claim to have a Johab encoding. I don't see a way around this
    at the moment. Just reencode them as unicode and all should be well.
  <LI>
    When reading in TrueType PfaEdit will not get the correct offset for composit
    glyphs where offsets are specified by point matching rather than as x,y values.
    (some mac fonts)
  <LI>
    My truetype hinting is still bad. Especially for diagonals.
  <LI>
    Some truetype fonts (kaiu and mingliu) do not store the correct outline.
    Instead they rely on using the instructions to move points around to generate
    the outline. The outline does not appear to be grid-fit at all, just positioned.
    PfaEdit will not read the instructions. In most fonts this would be the wrong
    thing to do, and I don't know how I could tell when it needs to be done...
  <LI>
    PfaEdit's support for the GPOS table output is limitted. Currently it only
    recognizes latin,cyrillic,greek,arabic and hebrew scripts. It assumes everything
    it doesn't recognize is latin. It makes at most two lookup tables for kerning
    one for left to right scripts, one for right to left scripts. If you want
    to work with a different script let me know, and let me know something about
    it. It should be easy enough to add (I hope). Furthermore I don't know what
    to do about digits which appear in arabic/hebrew in l2r ordering, so I shall
    give the r2l scripts access to both lookups.
  <LI>
    I'm told AutoKern doesn't work too well.
  <LI>
    PfaEdit is confused by small splines, on the order of one em unit. If you
    need something that small, scale the font up by a factor of 2 or more (including
    the ascent and descent).
  <LI>
    The MetaFont command doesn't work well.

  Installing it

it wherever you'd like.

  Running it
</H2>
<P>
<KBD>$ pfaedit font.pfa font2.pfb font3.sfd font4.ttf font5.otf font6.gsf
font7.bdf</KBD> <BR>
will start pfaedit looking at the fonts you specify on the command line.
It can read either pfb or pfa fonts, and some ps fonts (type 0 fonts based
on a type 1 dictionary) as well as truetype fonts, non-CID open type fonts
and bitmap fonts.<BR>
<KBD>$ pfaedit -new</KBD><BR>
will cause pfaedit to create a new font (in iso-8859-1 encoding)<BR>
<KBD>$ pfaedit</KBD><BR>
will open up a file picker dialog and allow you to browse till you've found
a font file (or have created a new one).

I'm sure you'll find some. If you can isolate it and come up with a reproduceable

you run it in gdb you should be able to get a stack trace... Do what you
can.
