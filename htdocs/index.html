<UL>
  <LI>
    22-July-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	wrote a unicode printf which is now used by most of the error routines. Should
	be no visible difference to users.
      <LI>
	cleaned up the truetype names aspect of the font info dlg.
      <LI>
	Added a Translate Styles button to the above aspect if the string is Style
	and the language is American English. (Sorry about the linguistic chauvanism)
      <LI>
	Allowed spaces in the Postscript family name again
      <LI>
	Fixed a bug where the "lpr" radio button would sometimes be disabled.
      <LI>
	Various other small improvements to "Print".
      <LI>
	The "Clockwise" detector failed on some paths. I've rewritten it, it should
	work better now.
      <LI>
	The clockwise detector in find problems also needed to be rewritten.
      <LI>
	Added a Find Problems detector for almost horizontal/vertical control points.
      <LI>
	Some improvements to metafont (well, a few characters look better anyway, I
	hope it's an improvement). It still doesn't work of course.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    17-July-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Using almost any stringized error routine would munch memory. Many inexplicable
	errors resulted. I hope it is now fixed and that PfaEdit is stable again.
      <LI>
	Valek's improvements to Find Problems
      <LI>
	Valek's russian version of "A quick brown fox..."
      <LI>
	use textarea gadget for Font's copyright notice.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    16-July-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit did not do a very good job of guessing at where hints should be active
	when they were supplied by the user. Should do better now.
      <LI>
	More tuneups for autohint.
      <LI>
	Added a command to the outline view to allow you to set the "First Point"
	of each spline set. This is important for Interpolate font.
      <LI>
	Fixed a bug in Font Reencoding having to do with references.
      <LI>
	Added direction detection to Find Problems (to make sure outer paths are
	clockwise)
      <LI>
	Cleared selections between explainations on Find Problems
      <LI>
	Gave some indication of how near horizontal/vertical lines are wrong in find
	problems
      <LI>
	Fixed a crash in MetaFont
      <LI>
	Added a progress indicator to MetaFont
      <LI>
	Added some more to the print sample text (bulgarian, macedonian, welsh, czech,
	lithuanian, polish, slovene)
      <LI>
	Stringized some more files
    </UL>
  <LI>
    15-July-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit should now be able to read truetype collection files and do something
	reasonable --<BR>
	At least in theory. I don't have any truetype collection files to test on.
      <LI>
	Oh dear. The rasterizer was looking at vertical hints when it should have
	looked at horizontal ones, looking at no hints when it should have looked
	at vertical ones. The result was that vertical edges weren't found.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit had problems reading in lone bdf fonts with strange encodings.
      <LI>
	Cleaned up print behavior slightly on systems without ghostview
      <LI>
	Find Problems would not always stop immediately after pressing the stop button.
      <LI>
	more files stringized
    </UL>
  <LI>
    11-July-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Eek! Memory problem in metrics view (writing beyond what was allocated).
	Fixed now.
      <LI>
	There is scrollbar in the metricsview again. This time it actually does
	something.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    10-July-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Did significant improvement to arabic ligature creation (at least it's done
	right to left now and the proper forms will be picked).
      <LI>
	Improved the character icons of Anti-Aliased fonts.
      <LI>
	Oops. FontInfo would mistakenly complain about modifiers like "-Bold". Fixed.
      <LI>
	There's the start of a <A HREF="MetaFont.html">command to change the weight
	of a font</A>. It doesn't work very well yet. It probably never will work
	perfectly, but I hope it may eventually be useful.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    7-July-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Fixed a crash when referring to a character whose encoding was bigger than
	65535
      <LI>
	Rewrote the <A HREF="fontinfo.html">Font Info</A> dlg.
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    Made the dialog controlled by tabs instead of trying to show everything at
	    once.
	  <LI>
	    Merged the private info dlg into it
	  <LI>
	    Provided access to some ttf settings which were previously hidden
	  <LI>
	    Provided access to the ttf name table (which allows you to give the font
	    and its styles different names on different languages. So CaslonItalic could
	    be CaslonItalique in French and CaslonKursive in German.
	</UL>
    </UL>
  <LI>
    30-June-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Fixed another crash from putting strings in resources.
      <LI>
	Added a snap-to feature on horizontal/vertical lines in the grid (guide)
	layer.
      <LI>
	Missing a few files in the distribution of the 28th.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    28-June-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Oops. Now all empty characters are nameless, not just controls.
      <LI>
	Many improvements to <A HREF="problems.html">find problems</A>.
      <LI>
	Added some new shortcuts to the menus.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    27-June-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	When generating truetype (or opentype) fonts, PfaEdit failed to set the
	ulCodePageRange for encodings other than latin1/latin2. Should do a better
	job now.
      <LI>
	Fixed a crash introduced by decompress.
      <LI>
	Fixed a crash when trying to merge two paths (by moving them with the mouse)
	when the stationary "path" consisted of exactly one point.
      <LI>
	Sometimes control characters would be named "uni0001" (etc.) rather than
	".notdef". Appropriate, but inconsistant. They should now always be called
	".notdef" (unless explicitly renamed).
    </UL>
  <LI>
    24-June-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Change configure script to work on solaris
    </UL>
  <LI>
    23-June-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Make giofile.c compile on solaris
      <LI>
	Fix crash in autohint
      <LI>
	Decompress compressed font files automagically before loading them
      <LI>
	Update russian version.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    21-June-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Copy Width did not work from the font view
      <LI>
	made the info display in the outline view more legible if the locale used
	"," as decimal point.
      <LI>
	One more attempt to get palettes right. They would disappear if you went
	to a non-outline view window and then returned to that same window.
      <LI>
	Some useful information will now be displayed in the outline view as you
	add points to a path.
      <LI>
	And during rectangle, elipse, polygon and star generation.
      <LI>
	Build Composit Char will now create the characters 0x2000-0x2015 (spaces
	and rules) if you ask it to.
      <LI>
	Fixed several bugs caused by the resource string changed.
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    This one showed up in font info when removing characters.
	  <LI>
	    And this on adding an encoding (to font info).
	  <LI>
	    Any simple request for a string got two OK buttons (ie. no Cancel)
	</UL>
      <LI>
	Added some more strings.
      <LI>
	Cleaned up the hint translation code to work with the new (ie. hint subtitution,
	diagonal)
      <LI>
	Improved UI for metrics view as per Valik's suggestions
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    Before it would wait until you depressed the mouse before changing the cursor,
	    now it changes the cursor as you move.
	  <LI>
	    Better cursors (seperate cursors for kerning, setting rbearing (== width),
	    setting lbearing)
	  <LI>
	    Selected character is drawn in a different color.
	</UL>
      <LI>
	Implement ghost/edge hints. (Oops)
    </UL>
  <LI>
    19-June-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Initial version of russian menus
      <LI>
	Recently AutoHint would remove control points from splines which traced out
	a line (ie. if the control points were on the line segment between the two
	end points). AutoHint shouldn't muck with things like that. And anyway it
	got it wrong in several cases.
      <LI>
	The simplify command will now remove colinear control points from a spline.
	And if you hold down the shift key when invoking the menu the simplify command
	will only do this (and will change its name to cleanup).
    </UL>
  <LI>
    18-June-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Oops. PfaEdit looked in the current directory, not the executable's directory
	for the ui files. Should be looking in the executable's dir.
      <LI>
	Oops. The "font has changed" dialog caused a crash.
      <LI>
	The simplify command will remove control points if the spline traces out
	a line.
      <LI>
	Cleaned up diagonal hints
      <LI>
	Made a change to menus which might fix Valek's menu crash. Or might not.
      <LI>
	Added some more strings to the ui files (yesterday files can't be used any
	more)
      <LI>
	Cleaned up some problems with the metrics view.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    17-June-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Added a minimal help menu
      <LI>
	If the Hint menu was invoked when there were not exactly two points selected,
	then pfaedit would crash. Fixed
      <LI>
	Created a superstructure to allow localization of the UI. Created a small
	(incomplete, probably wrong in many places) french ui.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    13-June-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Palettes would vanish when the first outline character view was closed. That
	should be fixed.
      <LI>
	Palettes should (I hope) do a better job of tracking windows.
      <LI>
	Fixed another clipping problem
      <LI>
	Added support for diagonal stems (for truetype instructioning. Not supported
	by postscript hints)
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    AutoHint finds them
	  <LI>
	    There's a Clear DStem command, and an Add DStem
	  <LI>
	    Review Hints does not display them (they can't be described the same way
	    as H and V stems).
	</UL>
      <LI>
	Changed the background color to be dark green so it will stand out against
	a filled character
      <LI>
	Previously if Pfaedit were given a corrupted font with no font name it would
	crash. That should be fixed.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    11-June-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Added ability to create a pfm file (for ATM under windows)
      <LI>
	Extended Font Info to allow you to set the FullName (the human readable font
	name) from FontInfo
      <LI>
	Two bugs with hint substitution code:
	<OL>
	  <LI>
	    It would occasionally generate one subr containing overlapping hints
	  <LI>
	    It would create a Subrs array much bigger than needed. For some reason xfs
	    had caniptions over the blank (but unused) entries
	</OL>
    </UL>
  <LI>
    6-June-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Cleaned up Exit, close and fontinfo commands to avoid possible race conditions.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    5-June-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Added a command to look for common problems
      <LI>
	Fixed a crash caused by removing character slots from a font (using Number
	of Characters in Font Info)
      <LI>
	Fixed a crash caused by reading in a ttf file where the kerning info specified
	a non-existant glyph
      <LI>
	Fixed a crash caused by reading in a pf* file where the encoding was specified
	in a slightly different format from the one we expect
      <LI>
	Palettes should be controllable again.
      <LI>
	Menu shortcuts should be available from palettes
    </UL>
  <LI>
    12-May-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	That was a stupid idea (yesterday's). I've backed it out. Instead I've done
	what Val asked for -- all windows share common palettes.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    11-May-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Made a preference item so that palettes could live within the outline view.
	It's sort of a temporary hack until I get palettes working (if ever) so it
	isn't really well integrated with things...
    </UL>
  <LI>
    10-May-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Fixed a crash bug which occurred when doing Transformations with the origin
	set to Center of Selection (default) in a character with an unclosed path.
      <LI>
	Fixed a similar crash when generating postscript.
      <LI>
	And another when updating control points.
      <LI>
	Added much to printing, should be done for now.
      <LI>
	Valrk Filippov suggested that things should be constrainable to angles other
	than horizontal, vertical and 45. In particular constraining to the ItalicAngle
	of an Italic/Oblique font is very useful. So we do that now. Thanks Val!
    </UL>
  <LI>
    7 May 2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Fixed more locale problems (I hope)
      <LI>
	Info line should show the location of a point moved with the arrows.
      <LI>
	Added Next/Prev Point commands
      <LI>
	Added a Print to file command that displays the entire font, or fills a page
	with the current character. More options to follow.
      <LI>
	Fixed a bug in seac output
      <LI>
	Fixed an introduced crash bug in hint output
      <LI>
	Fixed a crash bug caused by increasing the number of characters allowed in
	the font with FontInfo.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    6 May 2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Redid <A HREF="hinting.html">hinting</A> to support hint substitution and
	counter hinting in Postscript (&amp; opentype)
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    Hints now have an extent in both dimensions, indicating over what parts of
	    a character they should be active.
	  <LI>
	    Dotted lines are used to show the extent of a hint in the primary dimension
	  <LI>
	    I draw horizontal hints and vertical hints in different colors now, otherwise
	    it was too confusing guessing which was which.
	  <LI>
	    If a hint conflicts with another its dotted lines are shown in cyan (rather
	    than light blue/green)
	  <LI>
	    When the Review hints dlg is active the current hint is shown in dark blue/green.
	  <LI>
	    The Review hints dlg shows whether a hint overlaps (conflicts with) another.
	  <LI>
	    Auto Hinting will generate a list of all horizontal and vertical stems, and
	    then use some heuristics to remove some of the more annoying and less useful
	    stems from the Hint list. If you don't want this automatic pruning then holding
	    the Shift key down when you invoke AutoHint from the menu will leave you
	    with the full stem list.
	  <LI>
	    Minor changes to truetype output to deal with the new hint list.
	  <LI>
	    Major changes to PostScript output to deal with counters and hint substitution
	  <LI>
	    <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>No longer saves Type1 charstrings when loading
	    a type1 font</STRONG></FONT>
	</UL>
      <LI>
	The icon for outline character windows was <EM>still</EM> wrong for anti-alias
	fonts if there were no bitmap fonts installed. Sigh.
      <LI>
	Added a Correct Direction command to the font view.
      <LI>
	Fixed many bugs with Correct Direction
      <LI>
	Improved accent placement when we have serifs (I hope), don't want to center
	on top serif of "i" for example.
      <LI>

	PfaEdit no longer crashes on systems with no bitmap unicode fonts installed.
      <LI>
	When PfaEdit reads in a Type1 font it will preserve the original character
	strings (the type1 strings that define the glyph shape) and will write them
	out again when you save the font. If you modify a character (even something
	innocuous like setting the width) the string for that character will be lost.
	This means that any characters you do not modify will retain flex hints and
	hint substitution. (the Subrs and OtherSubrs arrays are also preserved).
      <LI>
	There is now a way to edit the entries in the Private dictionary (well most
	of them. No way to edit the Subrs entry). The program will guess at good
	values for some entries (like StdHW or BlueValues). If there is no BlueValues
	entry present when a type1 font is generated then the program will guess
	at good values (and will also guess at values for OtherBlues), otherwise
	it will use the one supplied. Similarly for StdHW and StdVW (if StdHW is
	absent then the program will guess at SnapStemH too, similarly for SnapStemV).
	If UniqueID is present in the Private dictionary then that value will be
	used in the font dictionary, if no UniqueID is present then the program will
	generate a random number in the allowed range.

PfaEdit is by no means complete. And probably doesn't work very well. Be
prepared to save frequently and always work on a copy of the original.
<UL>
  <LI>
    No attempt has been made to be efficient.
  <LI>
    No attempt has been made to read truetype instructions (hints)
  <LI>
    No attempt has been made to retain the change-over points for hint substitution.
    PfaEdit will refigure this when it saves the font.
  <LI>
    Many type 3 fonts will not be read in correctly (those generated by pfaedit
    should always be acceptable)
  <LI>
    Importing a type0 font loses the encoding. PfaEdit only imports simple type0
    fonts (such as those made by itself), will get confused if there's more than
    one font with a chars dictionary.

    My rasterizer will never be as good as adobe's.
  <LI>
    I think there are problems on Remove Overlaps.
  <LI>
    I'm told AutoKern doesn't work too well.
  <LI>
    PfaEdit is confused by small splines, on the order of one em unit. If you
    need something that small, scale the font up by a factor of 2 or more (including
    the ascent and descent).
  <LI>
    The MetaFont command doesn't work well.

  Installing it
</H2>
<P>
The executable tarball contains the pfaedit executable and a man page. Put
it wherever you'd like.
<P>
The build script will do an install to /usr/local/bin if you want it to.
<H2>
  Running it
</H2>
<P>
<KBD>$ pfaedit font.pfa font2.pfb font3.sfd font4.ttf font5.otf font6.bdf</KBD>
<BR>
will start pfaedit looking at the fonts you specify on the command line.
It can read either pfb or pfa fonts, and some ps fonts (type 0 fonts based
on a type 1 dictionary) as well as truetype fonts, non-CID open type fonts
and bitmap fonts.<BR>
<KBD>$ pfaedit -new</KBD><BR>
will cause pfaedit to create a new font (in iso-8859-1 encoding)<BR>
<KBD>$ pfaedit</KBD><BR>
will open up a file picker dialog and allow you to browse till you've found
a font file (or have created a new one).
<H2>
  Reporting <A NAME="bugs">bugs</A>...
</H2>
<P>
I'm sure you'll find some. If you can isolate it and come up with a reproduceable
minimal case, that would be great. The executable has symbols in it so if
you run it in gdb you should be able to get a stack trace... Do what you
can.
