</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>
    31-Oct-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Added a command to remove width MDs &amp; changed ttf generation to check
	if there were any width MDs before setting the "metrics depend on pointsize"
	flag in the head table.
      <LI>
	Improved (I hope) placement of palettes under default gnome.
      <LI>
	There was a bug in my otf read in of 'hflex1' instructions which warped some
	otf fonts badly.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    29-Oct-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Change type1 encoding vectors so that they start with a for loop setting
	everything to notdef. older versions of dvipdfm assume it's there
      <LI>
	Added two new concepts to hinting which only apply to truetype:
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    You can specify that a certain point should be rounded to the grid in x or
	    y<BR>
	    (note: points on hints don't need this, they'll always be rounded)
	  <LI>
	    You can specify that the x or y distance between two points should never
	    vanish (this is called Minimum Distance)<BR>
	    (note: each hint implies one of these going from one side of the hint to
	    the other, also there is an implied one of these between any two non-overlapping
	    hints)<BR>
	    You can also specify that the distance between a point and the width should
	    never vanish. This means that there will always be at least one pixel between
	    that point and the advance width of the character.
	</UL>
      <LI>
	I removed the serif checker from the ttf instruction generator and moved
	it to the autohinter (with some changes of course) and it now generates minimum
	distances.
      <LI>
	I added a minimum distance between the last stem of a character and the width.
      <LI>
	I added a user interface to display and control these
      <LI>
	I realized I was misinterpretting the ttf docs (again) and that IUP worked
	better than I thought, and so I removed my own interpolation code (thank
	you freetype! it is so good to see what the instructions do.)
      <LI>
	Cleaned up some rather technical issues in the truetype instruction generation
	occasioned by non-overlapping and non-intersecting hints.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit will now read (but not produce) '.gsf' files. These are yet another
	postscript format, like a pfa but without the eexec encoding. Ghostscript
	uses them (others may, I think Wadalab did...).
      <LI>
	Oops. In encodings containing characters with no defined postscript unicode
	names, then the name generated for an unused character was wrong.
      <LI>
	Oops. PfaEdit thought all user defined encodings were two byte encodings
	and produced a warning message for them when generating type1 fonts.
      <LI>
	Added a force encoding flag to the Font Info dlg. This is for those cases
	where PfaEdit reads in a font but can't figure out what the proper encoding
	is, then doing a force encoding will simply rename all the characters to
	match what they should be in the chosen encoding.
      <LI>
	Oops, neither afm nor bdf files were correctly normalized for fonts whose
	em size wasn't 1000.
      <LI>
	Improved bdf "CHARSET_COLLECTIONS" output.
      <LI>
	Added a command to make two lines parallel
    </UL>
  <LI>
    21-Oct-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit could crash when autohinting a diagonal hint.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    20-Oct-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit generated awful instructions (hints) for truetype characters. I've
	fixed some of the more egregious problems (I hope).<BR>
	In particular:
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    Diagonal hints were completely broken
	  <LI>
	    Overlapping hints didn't work either
	  <LI>
	    Normal hints with more than one point on them sometimes had the second (third,
	    fourth...) point moved by the wrong amount.
	  <LI>
	    Points that weren't on any hints were often not interpolated properly.
	  <LI>
	    The serif code picked up on things which weren't serifs and tried to hint
	    them as though they were.
	</UL>
	<P>
	I've written a <A HREF="TtfMod/index.html">tool</A> which will allow you
	to look at what the instructions are and what they do.
      <LI>
	TTF spline approximation (cubic-&gt;quadratic) should be twice as fast.
      <LI>
	Clearing/Cutting a character with references from the font view corrupted
	PfaEdit's internal state. If this were followed by a reduction in the number
	of characters in the font (Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;Encoding) a crash could
	occur.
      <LI>
	Clearing/Cutting a character with dependents from the font view now gives
	the user the option of instanciating the character in all its dependents.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    11-Oct-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Hmm. Apple has some very strange things to say about how offsets and scaling
	factors overlap in compound ttf glyphs. It is not well enough described (at
	least when it applies to rotations) for me to implement it. Microsoft doesn't
	do this. Great. OpenType gives a pair of bits to control this behavior (bit
	11 set do it apple's way, bit 12 set do it MS way, neither set flip a coin
	and guess, both set die in horrible agony). But still no description of exactly
	what Apple does. So I've changed my ttf output routine always to set bit
	12 in the composit flags. And the read in does something if it gets the apple
	bit. Probably not the right thing though.
      <LI>
	Fixed a potential problem clipping splines in the outline character display.
      <LI>
	Added a warning when attempting to save a font with a two byte encoding into
	a format that only supports one byte encodings (ie. unicode to pfb)
      <LI>
	PfaEdit crashed when loading a bare bdf with more than 256 characters
      <LI>
	PfaEdit used out of date versions of config.guess and config.sub. These should
	be updated now.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    3-Oct-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Added support for saving bitmaps into ttf files. I don't know that I've got
	it right. Windows Me ignores the bitmaps I put in. Windows may ignore all
	bitmaps, or I may have done something wrong... There are so few files to
	test bitmaps on though...
      <LI>
	Some older systems have problems taking the cubed root of 0. This can pop
	up in the Cubic Solution code now (when doing simplify for example). There
	should be a work-around in place now.
      <LI>
	On monospaced fonts PfaEdit generated a .notdef character whose width was
	the em-square rather than the size of the rest of the font.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    1-Oct-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	makefile wouldn't build ui files if "." wasn't in PATH environment variable.
	Should be fixed.
      <LI>
	Holding down the Shift key when invoking Element-&gt;AutoTrace will cause
	it to prompt for command line arguments to the autotrace program (you have
	to figure these arguments out yourself).
    </UL>
  <LI>
    30-Sept-2001/1-Oct-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Improved importing background bitmap fonts (scaling factor set more accurately,
	pk characters whose bitmap width was a factor of 8 had problems).
      <LI>
	Import width from background bitmap fonts if the outline character is empty.
      <LI>
	Merge Fonts was disabled except under bizarre circumstances, should be fixed.
      <LI>
	Makefiles should create the *.ui files now.
      <LI>
	Mac encoding table should include the Euro character now (I was using an
	old version which had the currency symbol instead).
    </UL>
  <LI>
    24-Sept-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	<A HREF="Problems-MacOSX.html">Mac OS/X port </A>done (or at least a semi-working
	version has been produced)
      <LI>
	Localization didn't work if there was no preference file. 
	  <HR>
      <LI>
	Can now read metafont pk files as bitmap fonts (Warning: No encoding on these
	files, you've got to guess at the encoding before loading them).
      <LI>
	Can now read kerning information from TeX .tfm files (Again, there's no encoding
	in these guys, I just assume the font's encoding matches the tfm)
    </UL>
  <LI>
    22-Sept-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Can now read bitmap fonts out of a truetype EBDT (or bdat) table
      <LI>
	Can import a bitmap and put it into the background of a font.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit would sometimes get character widths wrong when reading a ttc file.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    19-Sept-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Major rewrite of Remove Overlap.
      <LI>
	Fixed potential crash in autohint
      <LI>
	I now find the intersection of a (cubic) spline and a line by the cubic
	algorithem rather than by iteration.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    15-Sept-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Fixed more remove overlap/merge/simplify problems related to having many
	points at the same location.
      <LI>
	Fixed a bug in Point Info.

<P>
PfaEdit is by no means complete. And probably doesn't work very well. Be
prepared to save frequently and always work on a copy of the original.
<UL>
  <LI>
    No attempt has been made to be efficient.
  <LI>
    No attempt has been made to read truetype instructions (hints)
  <LI>
    No attempt has been made to retain the change-over points for hint substitution.
    PfaEdit will refigure this when it saves the font.
  <LI>
    Many type 3 fonts will not be read in correctly (those generated by pfaedit
    should always be acceptable)
  <LI>
    Importing a type0 font loses the encoding. PfaEdit only imports simple type0
    fonts (such as those made by itself), will get confused if there's more than
    one font with a chars dictionary.
  <LI>
    PfaEdit does not support the vertical metrics needed to do CJK fonts properly.
</UL>
<H2>
  <A NAME="known-bugs">Bugs</A>
</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>
    When reading in TrueType PfaEdit will not get the correct offset for composit
    glyphs where offsets are specified by point matching rather than as x,y values.
  <LI>
    OpenType fonts appear to store kerning data in the GPOS table rather than
    in the kern table. PfaEdit doesn't (yet) support the GPOS table, it will
    not read it in, and it will output a kern table if asked to save an otf font
    with kerning info.
  <LI>
    My rasterizer will never be as good as adobe's.
  <LI>
    I'm told AutoKern doesn't work too well.
  <LI>
    PfaEdit is confused by small splines, on the order of one em unit. If you
    need something that small, scale the font up by a factor of 2 or more (including
    the ascent and descent).
  <LI>
    The MetaFont command doesn't work well.
  <LI>
    PfaEdit does not deal with vertical metrics (for CJK characters).
  <LI>
    ???
</UL>
<H2>
  Installing it
</H2>
<P>
The executable tarball contains the pfaedit executable and a man page. Put
it wherever you'd like.
<P>
The build script will do an install to /usr/local/bin if you want it to.
<H2>
  Running it
</H2>
<P>
<KBD>$ pfaedit font.pfa font2.pfb font3.sfd font4.ttf font5.otf font6.bdf</KBD>
<BR>
will start pfaedit looking at the fonts you specify on the command line.
It can read either pfb or pfa fonts, and some ps fonts (type 0 fonts based
on a type 1 dictionary) as well as truetype fonts, non-CID open type fonts
and bitmap fonts.<BR>
<KBD>$ pfaedit -new</KBD><BR>
will cause pfaedit to create a new font (in iso-8859-1 encoding)<BR>
<KBD>$ pfaedit</KBD><BR>
will open up a file picker dialog and allow you to browse till you've found
a font file (or have created a new one).
<H2>
  Reporting <A NAME="bugs">bugs</A>...
</H2>
<P>
I'm sure you'll find some. If you can isolate it and come up with a reproduceable
minimal case, that would be great. The executable has symbols in it so if
you run it in gdb you should be able to get a stack trace... Do what you
can.
