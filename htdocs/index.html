    6 May 2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Redid <A HREF="hinting.html">hinting</A> to support hint substitution and
	counter hinting in Postscript (&amp; opentype)
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    Hints now have an extent in both dimensions, indicating over what parts of
	    a character they should be active.
	  <LI>
	    Dotted lines are used to show the extent of a hint in the primary dimension
	  <LI>
	    I draw horizontal hints and vertical hints in different colors now, otherwise
	    it was too confusing guessing which was which.
	  <LI>
	    If a hint conflicts with another its dotted lines are shown in cyan (rather
	    than light blue/green)
	  <LI>
	    When the Review hints dlg is active the current hint is shown in dark blue/green.
	  <LI>
	    The Review hints dlg shows whether a hint overlaps (conflicts with) another.
	  <LI>
	    Auto Hinting will generate a list of all horizontal and vertical stems, and
	    then use some heuristics to remove some of the more annoying and less useful
	    stems from the Hint list. If you don't want this automatic pruning then holding
	    the Shift key down when you invoke AutoHint from the menu will leave you
	    with the full stem list.
	  <LI>
	    Minor changes to truetype output to deal with the new hint list.
	  <LI>
	    Major changes to PostScript output to deal with counters and hint substitution
	  <LI>
	    <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>No longer saves Type1 charstrings when loading
	    a type1 font</STRONG></FONT>
	</UL>
      <LI>
	The icon for outline character windows was <EM>still</EM> wrong for anti-alias
	fonts if there were no bitmap fonts installed. Sigh.
      <LI>
	Added a Correct Direction command to the font view.
      <LI>
	Fixed many bugs with Correct Direction
      <LI>
	Improved accent placement when we have serifs (I hope), don't want to center
	on top serif of "i" for example.
      <LI>
	Slight improvements when pasting bitmaps.
      <LI>
	Oops. 0x2d should be "hyphen" in the Adobe Standard Encoding rather than
	"minus" as I had it.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    3 May 2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Opps. Generating postscript could crash if there were many blank characters.
      <LI>
	<FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>This is the last version which will allow you to
	make small modifications to fonts while retaining the original hint
	substitution</STRONG></FONT>
    </UL>
  <LI>
    28 Apr 2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Transform from the font view will (for some transformations and if
	<A HREF="editmenu.html#From">Copy From</A> is set to All Fonts) transform
	the bitmap associated bitmap characters as well as the outline characters.
      <LI>
	Cleaned up Build Accented character so that it behaves consistantly between
	font/outline views, works with Copy From. The two different aspects of the
	command (Accented vs. Composite) are now controlled by whether the Shift
	key is down when the menu is invoked.
      <LI>
	Some more locale tweaking for reading in/writing out postscript.
      <LI>
	The Preference encoding for new fonts didn't work if set to a user defined
	encoding. Should be fixed now.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    27 Apr 2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Tangent points should display a little better now.
      <LI>
	If a font is a 94x94 CJK font then the LanguageGroup field of the Private
	dictionary will be set to 1.
      <LI>
	Fixed a recently introduced crash bug that happens on non-unicode fonts with
	accented characters.
      <LI>
	If a character contained a reference and that character could not be converted
	into a seac then there would be no hints for the reference. That should be
	fixed now.
      <LI>
	Accented bitmaps should be positioned better now.
      <LI>
	Added a couple of progress indicators to font level operations (transform,
	paste, etc.)
      <LI>
	Expand stroke didn't work from the font view.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    23 Apr 2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Fixed a clipping problem
      <LI>
	Redid a change from yesterday. It should now work for the stuff that used
	to work (as well as for what I fixed yesterday)
      <LI>
	(moved to
	<A href="http://sourceforge.net"><IMG SRC="http://sourceforge.net/sflogo.php?group_id=25752&amp;type=1"

    </UL>
  <LI>
    22 Apr 2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Added code to allow users to select more than one bitmap font at a time to
	be imported into an sfd.
      <LI>
	Cleaned up opening a bdf file.
      <LI>
	Fixed various crash bugs dealing with missing bitmap characters where there
	were outline characters.
      <LI>
	Fixed various problems with building greek accented characters (Unicode 3's
	decompositions are no longer helpful)
      <LI>
	Added some support for
	<A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/type/corporateuse.txt">Adobe's
	documented corporate use</A> characters (Small Caps, Old Style numbers...)
      <LI>
	Cleaned up the outline character's icon (got broken when I added anti-aliasing)
      <LI>
	em space character kept vanishing. Fixed that.
      <LI>
	Fixed many other small bugs.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    20 Apr 2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Addition improvements to the handling of format0 (1byte) encodings
      <LI>
	Put a Symbol encoding into the FontInfo encoding list.
      <LI>
	Oops. Ligature's had their semi-colons in the wrong place in afm files.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    19 Apr 2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Yesterday's builds were transfered as ASCII not BINARY and are totally useless.
      <LI>
	Added a macintosh encoding to ttf output
      <LI>
	Slight improvement to ttf output (I hope)
    </UL>
  <LI>
    18 Apr 2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Crash when reading a ttf font fixed (introduced by ligature code).
      <LI>
	Crash when generating almost any postscript Type1 font (recently introduced)
      <LI>
	Added code to read ligature information from the TTF/OTF GSUB table.
      <LI>
	List buttons near the bottom of the screen would popup their list in
	inappropriate places.
      <LI>
	Fixed two bugs in cubic-&gt;quadratic spline conversion.
      <LI>
	Added support for TrueType Symbol encodings
    </UL>
  <LI>
    17 Apr 2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Menus would go into an infinite loop if you: depressed the mouse on the menu
	bar (and pulled down a menu) and then moved the mouse so that it was above
	the menubar when the menu was below it. Should be fixed.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    12 Apr 2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Added a submenu of recent files and a pull down list in the open dlg.
      <LI>
	Added stuff to put ligature info into an afm file (But not the GSUB table
	of ttf/otf)
    </UL>
  <LI>
    10 Apr 2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Fixed a crash bug when making an encoding from a font with a non-unicode
	character in it.
      <LI>
	Reencoding a font got confused if the new encoding contained more than one
	instance of the same glyph (common example is to have both 0x20 and 0xA0
	point to space) or if it contained a non-unicode character. This should be
	fixed now.
      <LI>
	Fixed a couple of problems with reading otf files
      <LI>
	Added ability to save an Open Type font
      <LI>
	Added a "Round to Int" command
      <LI>
	.sfd files contain decimal points. This means they are locale specific. Changed
	the input routines so that it would accept either "." or "," as a decimal
	point.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    2 Apr 2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit provides some support for XUIDs
      <LI>
	PfaEdit now has a button in the font info dialog which may be able to guess
	the italic angle for the font.
      <LI>
	AutoWidth/Kern didn't work well when the font was missing "A"
      <LI>
	AutoWidth/Kern didn't work well when the font was italic/oblique
      <LI>
	Build Accented Character didn't work too well when the font was italic/oblique
      <LI>
	Previously opening a Type1 font failed to read /OtherSubrs correctly
      <LI>
	Oops. In the Open Font Dialog, typing a wildcard changed the default button
	to [New] rather than [Filter]. And pressing on [Filter] caused a crash.
      <LI>
	Added ability to open an Open Type font (Postscript Type2 in a TrueType wrapper)
    </UL>
  <LI>
    29 Mar 2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	It is now possible to edit bdf fonts directly (without first creating a dummy
	postscript font to contain them)
      <LI>
	Fixed crash bug under kde
    </UL>
  <LI>
    28 Mar 2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Made it possible to for the user to new encodings
      <LI>
	(added TeX base encoding)
      <LI>
	slight improvements to the palette code
    </UL>
  <LI>
    26 Mar 2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Fixed a clipping problem in the Metricsview
      <LI>
	Fixed various other display problems in Metrics
      <LI>
	Fixed various display problems in the fontview
      <LI>
	Added "Remove All Kern Pairs" menu item
      <LI>
	Fixed Auto Kern yet again
      <LI>
	Added a preference item to control the foundry name for generated bdf fonts.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    25 Mar 2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Oops. Fixed a typo in auto-kerning code. It should work now...
      <LI>
	From the outline view, exporting to a bmp file allows you to save an anti-aliased
	character as well as a bitmap.
      <LI>
	The Generate Fonts command allows you to save anti-aliased greymap fonts.
	The format they are saved in was invented by me an hour ago so it's totally
	useless (it's exactly the same as bdf except there's one extra header
	"BITSPERPIXEL" which may be 1, 2, 4 or 8 (1 would be the same as bdf), and
	the number of pixels packed into a byte is 8/BITSPERPIXEL (so 8, 4, 2 or
	1 respectively).
      <LI>
	If you selected "No Outline font" in the Generate fonts dialog, it would
	generate a postscript font anyway. This has been fixed.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    24 Mar 2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	AutoKerning now lets you specify the number of kerning pairs the font may
	have.
      <LI>
	I'm told that ttf fonts can only have 2048 kerning pairs, so if a font has
	more, the ttf generator will only save the 2048 ones with the biggest (absolute)
	kerning offset.
      <LI>
	Fixed a bug in autowidth (would make some characters far too wide).
      <LI>
	Fixed a bug in autokern which caused it to kern things too closely together.
	This also reduced the number of kern pairs generated.
      <LI>
	Fixed a crash when loading a truetype font (if a glyph's start point and
	end point were both off-curve points then the point between them was interpolated
	incorrectly).
      <LI>
	PfaEdit should now work with XFree 4.0.* before it would crash after putting
	up the splash screen.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    21 Mar 2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Fixed yet another remove overlap bug.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    12 Mar 2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	a number of small improvements
      <LI>
	fixed a crash bug (occurred when holding down the alt key, using the pointer
	tool, and no reference was selected)
    </UL>
  <LI>
    9 Mar 2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Fixed a small bug in the hinting of glyph 0 (the unknown character)
      <LI>
	Added "rulers" to the character outline view
      <LI>
	Expanded the abilities of the postscript importer
      <LI>
	Fixed yet another clipping bug.
      <LI>
	Fixed a problem displaying tangent points when the control point was less
	than 1 unit away
      <LI>
	Provides an interface to the autotrace program to autotrace background images
      <LI>
	Fixed a crash when drawing large images.
      <LI>
	Fixed a problem with detecting clockwise paths.
      <LI>
	Fixed a bug with reading in Type3 fonts
    </UL>
  <LI>
    5 Mar 2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Minimal truetype instructing (hinting) is now in place.
	<TABLE CELLPADDING="2" BORDER=1>
	  <TR>

	  </TR>
	</TABLE>
	<P>
	This includes applying instructions to all points that lie on the Hints generated
	for Postscript, a certain amount of extra effort to detect serifs, and
	application of the PostScript BlueValues to the TrueType cvt.
      <LI>
	AutoHint has been improved for some characters again.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    4 Mar 2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	When Get Info is applied to a single selected reference character the dialog
	now has a button which will bring up a window displaying the character refered
	to.
      <LI>
	The Font View now displays info on the current character
      <LI>
	Selecting by dragging out a rectangle in the character outline view would
	sometimes miss points. I think that's fixed.
      <LI>
	Doing a multi-character copy in the fontview would remove non-existant characters
	from the copy set. They are no longer removed.
      <LI>
	Build Accented character would always use a dotlessi when building an character
	based on an "i". This behavior is only correct if the accent added is above
	the letter. Adding an ogonek for example should retain the dot. This is now
	fixed. (In theory the same problem could occur for j, but I don't think there
	are any cases where it does).
      <LI>
	When generating a type1 font PfaEdit will detect whether Flex hints can be
	used and use them if appropriate.
      <LI>
	There was a bug in the routine that read in flex hints. It would leave behind
	6 extra points not on any path in most characters with a flex hint. These
	points were not harmful, but they should not have been there.
      <LI>
	I found some cases where autohint picked the wrong hints. I cleaned them
	up. I hope I haven't broken others...
      <LI>
	Fixed another clipping problem.
      <LI>
	(Various experiments with instructing truetype have yielded no display
	improvement)
    </UL>
  <LI>
    25 Feb 2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit no longer crashes on high-end systems where the default visual has
	a smaller depth than the maximum the screen supports.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit no longer crashes on systems with no bitmap unicode fonts installed.
      <LI>
	When PfaEdit reads in a Type1 font it will preserve the original character
	strings (the type1 strings that define the glyph shape) and will write them
	out again when you save the font. If you modify a character (even something
	innocuous like setting the width) the string for that character will be lost.
	This means that any characters you do not modify will retain flex hints and
	hint substitution. (the Subrs and OtherSubrs arrays are also preserved).
      <LI>
	There is now a way to edit the entries in the Private dictionary (well most
	of them. No way to edit the Subrs entry). The program will guess at good
	values for some entries (like StdHW or BlueValues). If there is no BlueValues
	entry present when a type1 font is generated then the program will guess
	at good values (and will also guess at values for OtherBlues), otherwise
	it will use the one supplied. Similarly for StdHW and StdVW (if StdHW is
	absent then the program will guess at SnapStemH too, similarly for SnapStemV).

PfaEdit is by no means complete. And probably doesn't work very well. Be
prepared to save frequently and always work on a copy of the original.
<UL>
  <LI>
    No attempt has been made to be efficient.
  <LI>
    No attempt has been made to read truetype instructions (hints)
  <LI>
    No attempt has been made to generate instructions for diagonal stems
  <LI>
    No attempt has been made to retain the change over points for hint substitution.
    PfaEdit will refigure this when it saves the font.
  <LI>
    Many type 3 fonts will not be read in correctly (those generated by pfaedit
    should always be acceptable)
  <LI>
    Importing a type0 font loses the encoding. PfaEdit only imports simple type0
    fonts (such as those made by itself), will get confused if there's more than
    one font with a chars dictionary.

    PfaEdit is confused by small splines, on the order of one em unit. If you

  Installing it
</H2>
<P>
The executable tarball contains the pfaedit executable and a man page. Put
it wherever you'd like.
<P>
The build script will do an install to /usr/local/bin if you want it to.
<H2>
  Running it
</H2>
<P>
<KBD>$ pfaedit font.pfa font2.pfb font3.sfd font4.ttf font5.otf font6.bdf</KBD>
<BR>
will start pfaedit looking at the fonts you specify on the command line.
It can read either pfb or pfa fonts, and some ps fonts (type 0 fonts based
on a type 1 dictionary) as well as truetype fonts, non-CID open type fonts
and bitmap fonts.<BR>
<KBD>$ pfaedit -new</KBD><BR>
will cause pfaedit to create a new font (in iso-8859-1 encoding)<BR>
<KBD>$ pfaedit</KBD><BR>
will open up a file picker dialog and allow you to browse till you've found
a font file (or have created a new one).

  Reporting <A NAME="bugs">bugs</A>...
</H2>
<P>
I'm sure you'll find some. If you can isolate it and come up with a reproduceable
minimal case, that would be great. The executable has symbols in it so if
you run it in gdb you should be able to get a stack trace... Do what you
can.
