    3-Dec-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Merge Kern Info dlg crashed if you cancelled it.
      <LI>
	The encoding tables in the cmap are supposed to be ordered by platform and
	mine were not.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit would crash when writing out very large copyright notices
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    I lifted the 2000 character restriction on copyright strings.
	</UL>
      <LI>
	If there were more than 2 lines of tabs in a TabSet then clicking on a tab
	would often cause the wrong pane to appear.
      <LI>
	Cleaned up Font Info a bit so it looks better with the Russian translations.
      <LI>
	Fixed a memory leak when generating a truetype font with an encoding other
	than unicode.
      <LI>
	Fixed a crash when generating a truetype font which referenced characters
	with encodings bigger than 65535.
      <LI>
	Added a patch from Ulrich, PfaEdit now reads class based kerning from the
	GPOS table.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    1-Dec-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Figured out the format of mac .dfont files
      <LI>
	The mac Command (Apple, Cloverleaf) modifier key is now treated as if it
	were the Control key (So users may exit PfaEdit with Command-Q as they expect).
      <LI>
	Another bug reading in flex hints from OTF. Fixed by Ulrich Klauer.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit had problems with drawing images when there was an endian mismatch
	between the X server and the machine running pfaedit.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    27-Nov-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Build Accented Character failed to update bitmaps in CID keyed fonts
      <LI>
	Build Accented Character will generate rotated characters when appropriate
	for CID keyed fonts
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    If a character's name is "vertcid_&lt;cid&gt;" where &lt;cid&gt; should be
	    replaced by a number, then that character will be replaced by a rotated version
	    of &lt;cid&gt;
	  <LI>
	    If a character's name is "vertuni&lt;uni&gt;" where &lt;uni&gt; should be
	    replaced by a 4 hex-digit number, then that character will be replaced by
	    a rotated version of the unicode character &lt;uni&gt;.
	</UL>
      <LI>
	When saving a font with rotated characters PfaEdit will now generate a vrt2
	feature in the GSUB table (this lets the font's users find out about the
	rotated glyphs.
      <LI>
	Before this PfaEdit would only read entries in the 'name' table which were
	in unicode (or macroman). PfaEdit is a bit more general now and will read
	the other encodings it knows about.
      <LI>
	Oops. Another screw up reading in open type.
      <LI>
	If the character at encoding 0 was not .notdef then PfaEdit would omit it
	when generating a postscript/opentype font.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    26-Nov-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Adobe has upgraded their cid version for traditional chinese, so I generated
	a new cidmap to reflect that. I've also cleaned up most of the others.
      <LI>
	Initial version of vertical metric support.
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    (only in true/open type fonts)
	  <LI>
	    Added ability to set the vertical advance of each character
	  <LI>
	    Added ability to set the vertical origin (as an offset from the origin in
	    the design coordinate system (which happens to be the origin for horizontal
	    metrics)).
	  <LI>
	    Added ability to set the line gap (er, column gap?)
	  <LI>
	    What else do I need?
	</UL>
    </UL>
  <LI>
    24-Nov-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Oops. Urich Klauer found a bug in my parsing of ttf/otf tables (introduced
	by the linegap change on 8 Nov) and sent a patch.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit was erroneously complaining that all ttf composit glyphs were too
	big (when reading them in, introduced 15 Nov).
      <LI>
	PfaEdit stored StdHW and StdVW in the wrong format when reading opentype
	fonts and any .pfa/b fonts generated from that db caused ghostview problems.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    23-Nov-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Fixed a potential crash from popups in the fontview.
      <LI>
	Fixed three crashes in remove overlap (there are more problems)
      <LI>
	Added support for reading/writing mixed 8/16 bit encodings. (used in some
	CJK fonts)
      <LI>
	Added support for big5, johab (johab is untested, big5 minimally)
      <LI>
	Improved treatment of ttf encodings we don't understand.
      <LI>
	Added a command to move to the next defined character (useful in CJK encodings
	with great holes in the middle. Unicode too I suppose)
      <LI>
	Added a resource (<A HREF="xres.html">pfaedit.FontView.FontFamily</A>) to
	control the font for the character labels that appear above every user defined
	character.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit now supports multi-line copyright notices (must be less that 2000
	ascii characters though).
    </UL>
  <LI>
    17-Nov-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Changed the configure script to deal with Mac OS/X properly (I hope)
    </UL>
  <LI>
    15-Nov-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit had a bug when loading some ttc files which caused it to crash.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit wasn't prepared for the erroneous truetype found in wcl-02.ttf, this
	caused a crash. PfaEdit should do better now.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit's scrollbars didn't work very well. Should be much improved now.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit used to generate an entire antialiased bitmap font to display in
	the fontview window. Now it only generates the images when it needs them.
	This speeds up the loading of large fonts and reduces their memory requirements.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    12-Nov-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Some nearly horizontal (but non-linear) splines could not be selected.
      <LI>
	Changed the point info dlg so that users could set points back to have default
	control points.
      <LI>
	There was a pathway whereby points could be marked as having default control
	points even when they didn't. That one is plugged.
      <LI>
	The chinese font, kaui contains some interesting bugs which we've had to
	work around:
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    Glyph 257 contains a contour consisting of one off-curve point.
	  <LI>
	    The encoding cmap refers to non-existant glyphs
	  <LI>
	    The fpgm attempts to move points around (it isn't allowed to do that according
	    to the docs)
	</UL>
    </UL>
  <LI>
    11-Nov-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Added support for macintosh resource fonts (by reading them from and writing
	them to macbinary wrapped files)
      <LI>
	Fixed a bug in metricsview where pasting with more than one character caused
	a crash.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    8-Nov-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit will now save ligature information in the GSUB table when creating
	an opentype font.
      <LI>
	When double clicking on a previously unused character, PfaEdit would not
	set the default ligature properly.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit would crash if you merged a font containing ligature information
	into another one (or diagonal stems or minimum distances).
      <LI>
	When opening some bdf files, pfaedit would display nothing until you resized
	the window.
      <LI>
	Added the ability to set the TTF linegap fields. There are two of them (one
	in OS/2 and one in hhea). I don't understand the distinction between them,
	so I set both to the same value.
      <LI>
	When merging fonts, characters which did not fit in the current encoding
	would be placed immediately after the last character with something in it.
	The intent was that they should go to an unused slot outside of the encoding
	rather than within. This has been fixed.
      <LI>
	I've added a preference item allowing you to configure the seperation between
	the base character and the accent in the Build Accented Character command.
	I've also changed it so that if the character is close to the x-height or
	the cap height, the accent is positioned as if the character were at the
	x-height (or cap height), this means the accents will be at a consistent
	level rather than slightly ragged.
      <LI>
	I moved the Make First command to the Point menu.
      <LI>
	Added a command to copy the splines in the foreground layer into the background
	layer.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    2-Nov-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit would not notice certain disk errors when generating truetype fonts.
	It should do better now.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit could crash when generating postscript from a unicode font that did
	not contain all the greek letters.
      <LI>
	Fixed a display bug in the metrics view.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit should not be able to read in an opentype GPOS table and extract
	kerning information from it.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit will now put kerning info into the GPOS table when saving an opentype
	font. TrueType fonts will still put kerning info into the kern table.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    31-Oct-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Added a command to remove width MDs &amp; changed ttf generation to check
	if there were any width MDs before setting the "metrics depend on pointsize"
	flag in the head table.
      <LI>
	Improved (I hope) placement of palettes under default gnome.
      <LI>
	There was a bug in my otf read in of 'hflex1' instructions which warped some
	otf fonts badly.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    29-Oct-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Change type1 encoding vectors so that they start with a for loop setting
	everything to notdef. older versions of dvipdfm assume it's there
      <LI>
	Added two new concepts to hinting which only apply to truetype:
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    You can specify that a certain point should be rounded to the grid in x or
	    y<BR>
	    (note: points on hints don't need this, they'll always be rounded)
	  <LI>
	    You can specify that the x or y distance between two points should never
	    vanish (this is called Minimum Distance)<BR>
	    (note: each hint implies one of these going from one side of the hint to
	    the other, also there is an implied one of these between any two non-overlapping
	    hints)<BR>
	    You can also specify that the distance between a point and the width should
	    never vanish. This means that there will always be at least one pixel between
	    that point and the advance width of the character.
	</UL>
      <LI>
	I removed the serif checker from the ttf instruction generator and moved
	it to the autohinter (with some changes of course) and it now generates minimum
	distances.
      <LI>
	I added a minimum distance between the last stem of a character and the width.
      <LI>
	I added a user interface to display and control these
      <LI>
	I realized I was misinterpretting the ttf docs (again) and that IUP worked
	better than I thought, and so I removed my own interpolation code (thank
	you freetype! it is so good to see what the instructions do.)
      <LI>
	Cleaned up some rather technical issues in the truetype instruction generation
	occasioned by non-overlapping and non-intersecting hints.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit will now read (but not produce) '.gsf' files. These are yet another
	postscript format, like a pfa but without the eexec encoding. Ghostscript
	uses them (others may, I think Wadalab did...).
      <LI>
	Oops. In encodings containing characters with no defined postscript unicode
	names, then the name generated for an unused character was wrong.
      <LI>
	Oops. PfaEdit thought all user defined encodings were two byte encodings
	and produced a warning message for them when generating type1 fonts.
      <LI>
	Added a force encoding flag to the Font Info dlg. This is for those cases
	where PfaEdit reads in a font but can't figure out what the proper encoding
	is, then doing a force encoding will simply rename all the characters to
	match what they should be in the chosen encoding.
      <LI>
	Oops, neither afm nor bdf files were correctly normalized for fonts whose
	em size wasn't 1000.
      <LI>
	Improved bdf "CHARSET_COLLECTIONS" output.
      <LI>
	Added a command to make two lines parallel
    </UL>
  <LI>
    21-Oct-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit could crash when autohinting a diagonal hint.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    20-Oct-2001
    <UL>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit generated awful instructions (hints) for truetype characters. I've
	fixed some of the more egregious problems (I hope).<BR>
	In particular:
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    Diagonal hints were completely broken
	  <LI>
	    Overlapping hints didn't work either
	  <LI>
	    Normal hints with more than one point on them sometimes had the second (third,
	    fourth...) point moved by the wrong amount.
	  <LI>
	    Points that weren't on any hints were often not interpolated properly.
	  <LI>
	    The serif code picked up on things which weren't serifs and tried to hint
	    them as though they were.
	</UL>
	<P>
	I've written a <A HREF="TtfMod/index.html">tool</A> which will allow you
	to look at what the instructions are and what they do.
      <LI>
	TTF spline approximation (cubic-&gt;quadratic) should be twice as fast.
      <LI>
	Clearing/Cutting a character with references from the font view corrupted
	PfaEdit's internal state. If this were followed by a reduction in the number
	of characters in the font (Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;Encoding) a crash could
	occur.
      <LI>
	Clearing/Cutting a character with dependents from the font view now gives
	the user the option of instanciating the character in all its dependents.

	Hmm. Apple has some very strange things to say about how offsets and scaling
	factors overlap in compound ttf glyphs. It is not well enough described (at
	least when it applies to rotations) for me to implement it. Microsoft doesn't
	do this. Great. OpenType gives a pair of bits to control this behavior (bit
	11 set do it apple's way, bit 12 set do it MS way, neither set flip a coin
	and guess, both set die in horrible agony). But still no description of exactly
	what Apple does. So I've changed my ttf output routine always to set bit
	12 in the composit flags. And the read in does something if it gets the apple
	bit. Probably not the right thing though.
      <LI>
	Fixed a potential problem clipping splines in the outline character display.
      <LI>
	Added a warning when attempting to save a font with a two byte encoding into
	a format that only supports one byte encodings (ie. unicode to pfb)
      <LI>
	PfaEdit crashed when loading a bare bdf with more than 256 characters
      <LI>
	PfaEdit used out of date versions of config.guess and config.sub. These should
	be updated now.

	Added support for saving bitmaps into ttf files. I don't know that I've got
	it right. Windows Me ignores the bitmaps I put in. Windows may ignore all
	bitmaps, or I may have done something wrong... There are so few files to
	test bitmaps on though...
      <LI>
	Some older systems have problems taking the cubed root of 0. This can pop
	up in the Cubic Solution code now (when doing simplify for example). There
	should be a work-around in place now.
      <LI>
	On monospaced fonts PfaEdit generated a .notdef character whose width was
	the em-square rather than the size of the rest of the font.

PfaEdit is by no means complete. And probably doesn't work very well. Be
prepared to save frequently and always work on a copy of the original.

    No attempt has been made to be efficient.
  <LI>
    No attempt has been made to read truetype instructions (hints)
  <LI>
    No attempt has been made to retain the change-over points for hint substitution.
    PfaEdit will refigure this when it saves the font.
  <LI>
    Many type 3 fonts will not be read in correctly (those generated by pfaedit
    should always be acceptable)
  <LI>
    Importing a type0 font loses the encoding. PfaEdit only imports simple type0
    fonts (such as those made by itself), will get confused if there's more than
    one font with a chars dictionary.
</UL>
<H2>
  <A NAME="known-bugs">Bugs</A>

<UL>
  <LI>
    When reading in TrueType PfaEdit will not get the correct offset for composit
    glyphs where offsets are specified by point matching rather than as x,y values.
  <LI>
    Some truetype fonts (kaiu and mingliu) do not store the correct outline.
    Instead they rely on using the instructions to move points around to generate
    the outline. The outline does not appear to be grid-fit at all, just positioned.
    PfaEdit will not read the instructions. In most fonts this would be the wrong
    thing to do, and I don't know how I could tell when it needs to be done...
  <LI>
    PfaEdit's support for the GPOS table output is limitted. Currently it only
    recognizes latin,cyrillic,greek,arabic and hebrew scripts. It assumes everything
    it doesn't recognize is latin. It makes at most two lookup tables for kerning
    one for left to right scripts, one for right to left scripts. If you want
    to work with a different script let me know, and let me know something about
    it. It should be easy enough to add (I hope). Furthermore I don't know what
    to do about digits which appear in arabic/hebrew in l2r ordering, so I shall
    give the r2l scripts access to both lookups.
  <LI>
    My rasterizer will never be as good as adobe's.
  <LI>
    I'm told AutoKern doesn't work too well.
  <LI>
    PfaEdit is confused by small splines, on the order of one em unit. If you
    need something that small, scale the font up by a factor of 2 or more (including
    the ascent and descent).
  <LI>
    The MetaFont command doesn't work well.

  Installing it
</H2>
<P>
The executable tarball contains the pfaedit executable and a man page. Put
it wherever you'd like.
<P>
The build script will do an install to /usr/local/bin if you want it to.
<H2>
  Running it
</H2>
<P>
<KBD>$ pfaedit font.pfa font2.pfb font3.sfd font4.ttf font5.otf font6.bdf</KBD>
<BR>
will start pfaedit looking at the fonts you specify on the command line.
It can read either pfb or pfa fonts, and some ps fonts (type 0 fonts based
on a type 1 dictionary) as well as truetype fonts, non-CID open type fonts
and bitmap fonts.<BR>
<KBD>$ pfaedit -new</KBD><BR>
will cause pfaedit to create a new font (in iso-8859-1 encoding)<BR>
<KBD>$ pfaedit</KBD><BR>
will open up a file picker dialog and allow you to browse till you've found
a font file (or have created a new one).
<H2>
  Reporting <A NAME="bugs">bugs</A>...
</H2>
<P>
I'm sure you'll find some. If you can isolate it and come up with a reproduceable
minimal case, that would be great. The executable has symbols in it so if
you run it in gdb you should be able to get a stack trace... Do what you
can.
