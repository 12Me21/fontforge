<P>
<IMG SRC="privateinfo.png" WIDTH="303" HEIGHT="397" ALIGN="Right">This dialog
shows most entries in the font's Private dictionary. The interesting things
in this dictionary are mostly concerned with hints appropriate for the entire
font. I shall not go into detail about the meanings of the various entries,
that is best understood by reading
<A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/PDFS/TN/T1_SPEC.PDF">Adobe's
Type1 specification</A>.
<P>
Don't try to change these until you understand what they mean.
<P>
The dialog is shown at right. It consists of a list, an editable region and
a series of buttons. The list gives the names (keys) of the dictionary entries,
while the editable region displays the value of the currently selected entry.
To change an entry, simply select its key and then modify the value below.
<P>
For example the <CODE>BlueValues</CODE> entry specifies certain key regions
of the font in a vertical direction. For instance it might contain the baseline
serif, the x-height serif, the cap-height serif. It is expressed as an array
of numbers, grouped in pairs. The first number of a pair is the low end of
the region and the second is the high end. So in the example at right, the
value of <CODE>BlueValues</CODE> is <CODE>[-15 0 692 707 490 502 668 680
742 742]</CODE> (some of the array is not shown, and the scroll bar must
be used to display it).
<P>
When the <CODE>[Guess]</CODE> button is enabled PfaEdit thinks it can make
a reasonable guess for the value of the currently selected entry. Often two
entries in the dictionary will be closely linked and guessing at one will
also guess at the value of the other (PfaEdit will warn you of this). In
this case if PfaEdit were to guess the value of <CODE>BlueValues</CODE> it
would also guess the value of <CODE>OtherBlues</CODE>.
<P>
You may also delete an entry from the dictionary with the <CODE>[Remove]
</CODE>button. Some entries (such as <CODE>BlueValues</CODE>) are required
to be present in any type1 font, but you may still delete them. PfaEdit will
simply guess at a reasonable value when it needs to generate the font.
<P>
Not all the entries in the Dictionary have to do (directly) with hinting.
The Subrs and OtherSubrs entries provide subroutines which are used in displaying
the characters. Changing either of these could have disasterous effects on
the appearance of your font (the Subrs array is not even in human readable
format, and you aren't allowed to modify it). You may still delete them.
If you attempt to delete one you will delete both (they work together), and
you will also delete all the cached type1 strings attached to unmodifed
characters in your font.
<P>
<IMG SRC="privatekey.png" WIDTH="208" HEIGHT="146" ALIGN="Left"><IMG SRC="privatekeymenu.png"
    WIDTH="208" HEIGHT="202" ALIGN="Right">The <CODE>[Add]</CODE> button allows
you to add new keys to the dictionary. Every key will be added with a blank
value, and you will almost certainly need to provide an appropriate value
for it. When you press <CODE>[Add]</CODE> a dialog pops up which allows you
to enter the key's name. There is a pull down list of known keys (that aren't
already in the dictionary), or you may add keys by typing them in.
<P>
Certain keys affect things other than hints. The <CODE>lenIV</CODE> entry
controls how much random padding is placed around the type1 strings when
the font is generated. Normally this will be 4, but if you want to save space
(4 bytes per character in pfb format, 8 bytes in pfa) you may choose another
value. The UniqueID key represents the font's Unique postscript ID. If you
provide a value here then PfaEdit will copy it into the UniqueID field in
the Font Dictionary. If you do not provide a UniqueID here, PfaEdit will
generate a random one itself.
<P Clear=All>
Finally there is a <CODE>[Done]</CODE> button. This removes the Private dialog.
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: changes happen as you make them. There is no Cancel
button, no Undo function.
