The Font Info dialog is available from all views. It allows you to name your
font and various other useful bits of information. In a
<A HREF="fontview.html#CID">CID keyed font</A>, there is a
<A HREF="cidmenu.html#FontInfo">separate command</A> to access the information
for the font as a whole, the dialog looks the same. The dialog is composed
of many different sub dialogs.

<P>
Postscript fonts have several different names, but basically there are two
important ones: the family name (like Times) and the fontname (which is the
family name with a bunch of modifiers like Bold Italic Condensed tacked on
to the end. The FullName is designed to be read by humans, while the others
are for machines, this name can contain spaces (like "New Century Schoolbook-Bold
Condensed"). Finally there is the weight name. All of these names should
be in ASCII. If you wish to enter names with characters outside this range
look at the <A HREF="#TTF-Names">TTF Names</A> Section.
<P>
The copyright field can contain whatever you want to put there, but it's
a good place to put a copyright.
<P>
In most fonts the version field is a string (and so has minimal constraints
on it), but in CID keyed fonts it must be a floating point number.
<P>
Many of these names are similar to the english names of the TTF Names section.
If nothing is specified in that section then the names specified here will
be used by default in ttf files.
<H2>
  <IMG SRC="fontinfo-ps.png" WIDTH="376" HEIGHT="608" ALIGN="Right"><A NAME="PS-General">General</A>
</H2>
<P>
This sub dialog contains a rather random collection of settings.
<P>
The Ascent and Descent are (in this current definition) Macintosh concepts
rather than Postscript, their sum, however, provides the size of the em-square
and that is very much a postscript concept. For postscript fonts this number
is set by strong convention to be 1000, while in most TrueType fonts it will
be 2048 (also a convention, but TrueType claims rasterization is faster if
the sum is a power of 2). Since both TrueType and Type1 (postscript) fonts
represent numbers as 16-bit integers ascent and descent must be less than
32767. TrueType is more restrictive and requires their sum to be less than
16384.
<P>
If you change the size of the Em you may choose to have all the outlines
(and kerning info) scaled to have the same proportion to the new value that
they had to the old.
<P>
The Italic Angle indicates the slant of the font. FontForge can attempt to
guess a good value for you by looking at the stems of certain letters ("I"
for instance).
<P>
The underline position and height provide a program using this font a hint
as to where it should place a line if it wants to underline text printed
in this font.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="Red"><SMALL><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG></SMALL></FONT>
<A HREF="UniqueID.html">Adobe now says</A> that both XUID and UniqueID are
unnecessary.
<P>
The XUID field is a collection of numbers separated by spaces and enclosed
in brackets. This allows you to specify the extended unique ID of the font.
If you have set the XUID preference entry then FontForge will assign values
to all new fonts (by appending a number unique to this font to the end of
your preference item). Adobe recommends that the XUID be changed every time
the font is changed, so each time you generate a postscript font, that font's
XUID (if present) will be incremented by 1 (This incrementing does not happen
in CID-keyed fonts, where the XUID behavior is too complex for this simple
trick). (The XUID field is only meaningful in PostScript fonts).
<P>
The UniqueID field is an older convention for the same purpose as XUID. If
you do not fill in this field then FontForge will pick a random number for
you in the allowable range. If you want your font to have no unique id then
give this the value of -1. If you have talked to Adobe and been assigned
a real UniqueID then you may use this field, otherwise leave it blank. (The
UniqueID field is only meaningful in PostScript fonts)
<P>
If you want your font to have <A NAME="vertical">vertical</A> metrics (generally
this means you are working on a CJK font) then check the <CODE>[*] Has Vertical
Metrics</CODE> checkbox. This will enable the Vertical Origin field, and
will mean that when you generate a truetype or opentype font a vertical metrics
table will be added. The Vertical Origin is the vertical offset from the
origin of the design coordinate system to the origin for the purposes of
vertical metrics.
<P>
If you check <CODE>[*] Quadratic Splines </CODE>then FontForge will use quadratic
<A HREF="overview.html#spline">B&eacute;zier</A> splines for this font rather
than cubic B&eacute;ziers, this means that FontForge will be using the native
spline format of truetype rather than postscript (or opentype). When FontForge
generates a font it will convert from whatever format is used internally
to whatever format is required for the font, so there will be no problem
if this is set incorrectly, but setting it correctly for your font means
you get a clearer idea of what the outlines will look like. I find quadratic
splines harder to edit with because each spline is less flexible (and a number
of FontForge's commands will not work on them), but the advantage of actually
seeing what your truetype font will look like may outweigh that.
<P>
If you have configured FontForge for <A HREF="multilayer.html">multi-layered
editing</A> there will also be a radio button here to turn that on.
<P>
You can also indicate that you are making a stroked font where every spline
is stroked with a circular pen of the given width.
<P>
<A NAME="Interpretation">Sadly</A> the encoding is not always sufficient
for understanding the font's behavior. For example a unicode font designed
for a chinese system will look very different from a unicode font for a japanese
system (The same unicode character may map to very different chinese or japanese
glyphs). To handle this (and some other cases) FontForge has the concept
of "Interpretation". There are several cases in which this field is useful.
<UL>
  <LI>
    To allow FontForge to know whether a Unicode (or any other non-CJK encoding
    which includes CJK glyphs) font should be viewed as Japanese, Chinese or
    Korean.
  <LI>
    Can cause FontForge to use the names "Delta.greek", "Omega.greek" and "mu.greek"
    for U+0396, U+03a9, U+03bc (instead of uni0396, etc.).
  <LI>
    Can cause FontForge to name glyphs in the public use area after Adobe's
    assignments to that area (ie. small caps, etc.)

<P>
<IMG SRC="fontinfo-private.png" WIDTH="376" HEIGHT="544" ALIGN="Right">This
sub-dialog shows most entries in the font's Private dictionary. The interesting
things in this dictionary are mostly concerned with hints appropriate for
the entire font. I shall not go into detail about the meanings of the various
entries, that is best understood by reading
<A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/PDFS/TN/T1_SPEC.PDF">Adobe's
Type1 specification</A>.
<P>
Don't try to change these until you understand what they mean.
<P>
The dialog is shown at right. It consists of a list, an editable region and
a series of buttons. The list gives the names (keys) of the dictionary entries,
while the editable region displays the value of the currently selected entry.
To change an entry, simply select its key and then modify the value below.
<P>
For example the <CODE>BlueValues</CODE> entry specifies certain key regions
of the font in a vertical direction. For instance it might contain the baseline
serif, the x-height serif, the cap-height serif. It is expressed as an array
of numbers, grouped in pairs. The first number of a pair is the low end of
the region and the second is the high end. So in the example at right, the
value of <CODE>BlueValues</CODE> is <CODE>[-20 0 437 457 583 603 623
643</CODE>.
<P>
When the <CODE>[Guess]</CODE> button is enabled FontForge thinks it can make
a reasonable guess for the value of the currently selected entry. Often two
entries in the dictionary will be closely linked and guessing at one will
also guess at the value of the other (FontForge will warn you of this). In
this case if FontForge were to guess the value of <CODE>BlueValues</CODE>
it would also guess the value of <CODE>OtherBlues</CODE>.
<P>
The [Hist] button is similar, it will bring up a
<A HREF="histogram.html">dialog showing a histogram</A> of the values of
an attribute of the font. The hope is that this will allow you to pick a
good value for the entry.
<P>
You may also delete an entry from the dictionary with the <CODE>[Remove]
</CODE>button. Some entries (such as <CODE>BlueValues</CODE>) are required
to be present in any type1 font, but you may still delete them. FontForge
will simply guess at a reasonable value when it needs to generate the
font.<BR Clear=Right>
<P>
<IMG SRC="privatekey.png" WIDTH="208" HEIGHT="146" ALIGN="Left"><IMG SRC="privatekeymenu.png"
    WIDTH="208" HEIGHT="202" ALIGN="Right">The <CODE>[Add]</CODE> button allows
you to add new keys to the dictionary. Every key will be added with a blank
value, and you will almost certainly need to provide an appropriate value
for it. When you press <CODE>[Add]</CODE> a dialog pops up which allows you
to enter the key's name. There is a pull down list of known keys (that aren't
already in the dictionary), or you may add keys by typing them in.
<P>
Certain keys affect things other than hints. The <CODE>lenIV</CODE> entry
controls how much random padding is placed around the type1 strings when
the font is generated. Normally this will be 4, but if you want to save space
(4 bytes per glyph in pfb format, 8 bytes in pfa) you may choose another
value. The UniqueID key represents the font's Unique postscript ID. If you
provide a value here then FontForge will copy it into the UniqueID field
in the Font Dictionary. If you do not provide a UniqueID here, FontForge
will generate a random one itself (this is different from True Type's UniqueID.
They perform the same function but are formatted differently).
<P>
These entries are only meaningful for PostScript fonts.<BR CLEAR=ALL>

  <IMG SRC="fontinfo-ttfvals.png" WIDTH="376" HEIGHT="608" ALIGN="Right"><A
      NAME="TTF-Values">OS/2</A>
</H2>
<P>
This sub dialog contains settings important for Windows platforms, most of these
settings live in the 'OS/2' table of a truetype or opentype font. The pane also includes
a few pieces of data that do not live in the 'OS/2' table but are logically
related.
<P>
The weight class provides a numeric value describing the boldness of the
font. A normal face will usually have a boldness of 400, and a bold face
will usually be 700. This must be a number between 100 and 900.
<P>
The width class allows you to provide a numeric value saying how condensed
or expanded this font is.
<P>
The PFM Family is used when generating PFM files and classifies the font
into some rather broad categories (Serif, Sans, Monospace, Script, Decorative).
<P>
You can control whether you want to allow your font to be embedded into other
documents (most commonly pdf). You can restrict it so that it can never be
embedded, it can be embedded into documents that can be printed (but not
edited), it can be embedded into documents that can be edited, or it can
be embedded into an editable document and later extracted and installed on
a different system. You can also control whether the document producer is
allowed to extract the glyphs it needs and make a new font from them (which
saves space) or whether they must include the entire font if they use any
of it. Finally you can restrict the embedding so that only bitmap versions
of the font may be embedded. (meaningful in CID keyed postscript fonts as
well as TTF and OTF).
<P>
The "Vendor ID" is a four character ASCII field used to identify the creator
of the font.
<P>
The IBM Family is another classification scheme for fonts.
<P>
Finally you may order lookups in the GSUB (or morx) table.
<P>
These entries are only meaningful in TrueType and OpenType fonts (though
the Embeddable entry (generally called FSType) will be set on CID keyed fonts
even if they are not in an OpenType wrapper.<BR CLEAR=ALL>

</H3>
<P>
This dialog allows you to control the order features in which are to be executed
by the word processing program. If you have loaded an opentype or truetype
font then the original order will be maintained. As you add more features
they will appear at the bottom of the list (which may not be appropriate).
You may select a feature name and use the buttons to move it up and down
in the list. Things at the top of the list are executed first, things at
the bottom last.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Caveat: </STRONG></FONT>Although the OpenType spec
claims that the execution of features (actually lookups) will be ordered
by their appearence in the lookup table, MicroSoft claims that they will
apply features in the order that they think best. So the order specified
in the font may be ignored.<BR CLEAR=ALL>

  <IMG SRC="fontinfo-ttfmetrics.png" WIDTH="376" HEIGHT="608" ALIGN="Right"><A
      NAME="TTF-Metrics">OS/2 Metrics</A>
</H2>
<P>
The Windows Ascent and Descent fields are badly defined in the OpenType spec,
which says that they should express the maximum range of the Windows "ANSI"
glyphs. If one uses this definition, non-"ANSI" glyphs are cropped. These
should be the maximum range of all glyphs to avoid cropping. But even that
will not always work. If you have a line with marks which are repositioned
with GPOS, then the marks may be cropped, so Windows Ascent should include
the maximum possible height of repositioned marks (or any other GPOS vertical
repositioning feature).
<P>
This is too complex (and too ill defined) for FontForge to figure out, instead
FontForge gives you a couple of options.
<OL>
  <LI>
    You may set WinAscent and WinDescent directly. Turn off the "[ ] Is Offset"
    checkboxes and any value you provide will be used as is.
  <LI>
    Or you may specify an offset to be added to the maximum ascent and descent
    of the font (which FontForge will compute for you when it saves the font).
    If you don't have a mark to base feature, then I recommend that you set the
    offsets to 0, and check the "[*] Is Offset" checkboxes.
</OL>
<P>
Both WinAscent and WinDescent should be positive numbers.
<P>
The Typographic Ascent and Typographic Descent are <EM>supposed</EM> to represent
the line spacing of the font on the windows platform. Sadly very few applications
actually use them (most applications use the Windows Ascent/Descent described
above).
<P>
In traditional (Latin) typography, the unleaded line spacing should be 1em,
and that is what Adobe recommends for these fields (they should sum to the
Em-Size specified in the <A HREF="fontinfo.html#PS-General">General</A> pane).
The Typographic Ascent should be the same as the font's Ascent, and the
Typographic Descent should be the (negative) of the font's descent.
<P>
The "[*] Is Offset" checkboxes behave much as they do above, except they
specify offsets from the font's ascent and descent rather than its bounding
box.
<P>
The Typographic descent should be a negative number, the ascent a positive
number.
<P>
You can also specify the default line gap, or leading between lines.
<P>
The mac uses a different set of fields for the same concepts, and stores
them in the 'hhea' table rather than the 'OS/2'. The HHead Ascent and Descent
are used to specify clipping (in some applications) and line spacing. They
behave very much the way the Win Ascent &amp; Descent behave (they are based
on bounding box values). And the 'hhea' table has its own line gap field.
<P>
And if your font has vertical metrics enabled (See
<A HREF="fontinfo.html#PS-General">General</A> above) you will be able to
set the default spacing between vertical columns of text. (the equivalent
to LineGap in vertical text).<BR CLEAR=ALL>

The OS/2 table also contain information on scaling and positioning subscripts
and superscripts.
<P>
Most fonts don't really need this control. If you leave the [*] Default check
box on, then FontForge will generate some reasonable values on output (if
nothing significant changes, it will use the values shown here). If you want
control of these values, turn off the checkbox and the text fields will be
enabled for you to change.<BR Clear=ALL>

This sub-dialog allows you to describe your font in 10 different dimensions.
The exact meanings of many of these entries vary from script to script, and
even the Latin ones are not clear to me, I have merely typed them in as specified
in the <A HREF="http://fonts.apple.com/TTRefMan/RM06/Chap6OS2.html">true

TrueType (and OpenType) fonts are allowed to have different names in different
languages. So a French user might see CaslonItalic displayed as CaslonItalique
in a font menu, while a German user might see CaslonKursive. There are about
20 different strings which may be customized into various different languages.
Customizing one string does not mean that you must customize the others (indeed,
usually only the Style string is customized).
<P>
The image at right shows the dialog, displaying all the strings set for the
given font. You may order these strings based on type of string (ordered
as below), on language (ordered by unicode), or by a variation of language
which displays strings for the language of the current locale first, then
English strings (because, in general, these will be the most important for
the user) and then ordered by language thereafter.
<P>
Certain strings in English (Copyright, Family, Styles, Fullname, Version)
will always be present. If you do not set them explicitly they will be taken
(possibly with modifications) from the equivalent postscript strings on the
Names pane. You may not remove these strings, and if you wish to modify them
you must first detach them from the PostScript. In the example at right the
strings bound to PostScript are shown in red (Copyright, Family, Styles),
while Fullname and Version have been detached and modified.
<P>
You may change the language of a string by clicking the mouse on the language
field of that string -- a popup menu will appear giving you a choice of all
supported locale/languages. (You may not modify the language of the special
English strings mentioned above).
<P>
You may change the string type in a similar manner, again you may not change
the special English strings.
<P>
If you click with the right button on a string you will bring up a different
popup menu which will allow you to:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Detach a string from its PostScript equivalent if any (so you can modify
    it)
  <LI>
    Delete a string entirely (except for the special strings bound to PostScript)
  <LI>
    Edit a string in a larger window.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
</UL>
<P>
If you click with the left button on a string value you may edit that string
in line, if it is small enough,
<IMG SRC="fontinfo-ttfname-bigedit.png" WIDTH="343" HEIGHT="341" ALIGN="Right">otherwise
in a larger window.
<P>
If you wish to add a new string, click on the &lt;New&gt; entry at the bottom.
You will be given the standard language popup and it will create a new string
for you.
<P>
The various strings and a brief description of their meanings are:
<DL>
  <DT>
    Copyright
  <DD>
    Allows you to specify the copyright message
  <DT>
    Family
  <DD>
    The font's family name
  <DT>
    Styles (SubFamily)
  <DD>
    This should (in English) have values like "BoldItalicCondensed". This is
    the most likely string to change in different languages.
  <DT>
    Fullname
  <DD>
    The concatenation of the Family name and the Styles name
  <DT>
    UniqueID
  <DD>
    This is a string that uniquely identifies the font in a human readable fashion.
    It's format is quite different from postscript's UniqueID and FontForge will
    create an appropriate string if you don't specify one (rather than copying
    from postscript).
  <DT>
    Version
  <DD>
    A string containing the version number of the font.
  <DT>
    Postscript Name
  <DD>
    (FontForge will not let you set this directly. It will be set automatically
    to the postscript fontname, only one instance of this tag is allowed in the
    font and it must be ASCII)
  <DT>
    Trademark
  <DD>
    A string containing any trademark information for the font.
  <DT>
    Manufacturer
  <DD>
    The name of the company that distributes the font.
  <DT>
    Designer
  <DD>
    The name of the person who designed the font.
  <DT>
    Descriptor
  <DD>
    A description of the font and its characteristics.
  <DT>
    VendorURL
  <DD>
    An URL pointing to the font's vendor.
  <DT>
    DesignerURL
  <DD>
    An URL (often an e-mail address) pointing to the font's designer
  <DT>
    License
  <DD>
    A string describing the license terms under which the font is marketed
  <DT>
    License
  <DD>
    An URL pointing to a page describing the terms of the license
  <DT>
    Preferred Family
  <DD>
    This is to get around a quirk of windows where only four Style names are
    allowed per family, so font families with more than four styles would get
    different family names above, but the preferred family name would be the
    same. This should only be specified if it differs from the family
  <DT>
    Preferred Style
  <DD>
    This is similar to the above, except it applies to the style.
  <DT>
    Compatible Full
  <DD>
    This is to get around a quirk on the Mac.
  <DT>
    Sample Text
  <DD>
    Whatever.

<P>
When you create a Style entry for an language, FontForge will attempt to
translate the American English style into something appropriate for that
language. It understands the above table, but not other languages so it won't
always work. So if your style in American English is "BoldItalic" then after
you create the appropriate strngs FontForge will default to "GrasItalique"
for French, "FettKursiv" for German,
"&Ouml;&Eacute;&Ograve;&Icirc;&Ugrave;&Ecirc;&euml;&Otilde;&Ograve;&Oacute;&Eacute;&#215;&Icirc;&Ugrave;&Ecirc;"
for Russian and "NigritaCursiva" for Spanish.
<P>
These names are only meaningful for TrueType and OpenType fonts.
<H2>
  <IMG SRC="fontinfo-tex.png" WIDTH="376" HEIGHT="600" ALIGN="Right"><A NAME="TeX">TeX</A>
</H2>
<P>
This allows you to set the TeX font parameters (which are described in Appendix
F, pp 98-100 of the MetaFont Book). There seem to be 3 different types of
font parameters, those for text fonts, those for math fonts and those for
math extension fonts. The later two have additional parameters which are
accessible through the [More Params] button. The default values for the Math
parameters are probably reasonable. <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>The default
values for the Math Extension parameters are probably
unreasonable</STRONG></FONT>.
<P>
These values are stored in tfm files (should you generate a tfm file with
your font).<BR Clear=All>
<H2>
  <IMG SRC="fontinfo-size.png" ALIGN="Right" WIDTH="376" HEIGHT="601"><A NAME="Size">Size</A>
</H2>
<P>
This allows you to set the design size of a font, the design range, and provide
a style name for this class of font.
<P>
In tradtional typography every point size of a given font would be slightly
different -- generally small point sizes would have proportionally more
white-space around the glyph and wider stems inside the glyph. This made
small point sizes more readable than they would otherwise be. Conversely
large pointsizes would tend to have less white space around them, otherwise
the letters would appear too far apart.
<P>
<A HREF="multiplemaster.html">Multi-master fonts</A> provide one method to
avoid this problem. This dialog provides another. Suppose you have a series
of font-faces designed for different point-sizes.
<TABLE CELLPADDING="2">
  <TR>
    <TD>Ambrosia-Regular-Small</TD>
    <TD>&lt;9pt</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Ambrosia-Regular-Text</TD>
    <TD>9-13pt</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Ambrosia-Regular-Heading</TD>
    <TD>14-23pt</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Ambrosia-Regular-Display</TD>
    <TD>&gt;=24pt</TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Then you would fill in this dialog to allow the font system to figure out
which font was appropriate for which point size. The dialog displays the
font's optimal size -- it's design size, and the point range within which
it can be used.
<P>
In the example above all the different fonts would have the same "Style-ID"
this is an arbetrary number that links all fonts with this ID together (all
fonts in the same family, that is). However, Ambrosia-Italic-Text would have
a different Style ID. All fonts with the same Style ID should have the same
Style Name. Note that font names are now something like
"Ambrosia-Regular-Heading" -- the user should not be subjected to that
complication, as far as s/he is concerned there is just a font called
"Ambrosia-Regular" and all four of the above fonts are just instances of
it. So the Style Name of all four fonts above should be "Regular"<BR Clear=All>
<H2>
  <IMG SRC="fontinfo-comment.png" WIDTH="369" HEIGHT="506" ALIGN="Right"><A

</H2>
<P>
This allows you to keep track of arbitrary comments inside your font database.
It does not correspond to any postscript or truetype entity. It is intended
to store a changelog for the font itself, but could be used for other purposes...
<P>
Various font formats allow a random comment to be place in the font, but
no format makes use of it. This is primarily to be used inside FontForge.
The comment should be in ISO Latin1.

rearrangement and allow ligatures to be formed which skip over certain glyphs.
Each class of marks should be named and that name may be used in the
<A HREF="charinfo.html">Element-&gt;Glyph Info</A>-&gt;Ligature-&gt;New dialog
to specify which marks should be considered in forming this ligature and
which should be ignored.

<P>

This sub-dialog allows you to control the
<A HREF="overview.html#Anchors">Anchor Classes</A> used in your font. Anchor
classes need a name and a tag. Generally you want to use the default tag
of 'mark' (but see the discussion in the
<A HREF="overview.html#Anchors">overview</A> of when you might not).
<P>
From here you may add new classes, delete old ones or rename old ones. You
may also bring up outline glyph views looking at the glyphs which use these
classes.
<P>
<IMG SRC="newanchor.png" WIDTH="226" HEIGHT="391" ALIGN="Left">The dialog
for creating a new (or modifying an old) anchor class allows you to give
that class a name and requires that you associate it with a set of
<A HREF="charinfo.html#Feature-Tag">scripts and languages</A>. You may also
set some standard OTF flags.
<P>
There are three different types of anchor classes (well there are four, but
FontForge doesn't need to distinguish between two of them), Mark to Base,
Mark to Mark and Cursive. When you create an anchor class you must select
which type it will be.
<UL>
  <LI>
    Mark to Base is used for connecting marks (diacritic marks such as accents)
    to base letters or ligatures
  <LI>
    Mark to Mark is used for connecting two marks together (when you have several
    marks that interact in their positioning when applied to the same letter)
  <LI>
    Cursive is used to join two letters so they will give the illusion of cursive
    script.
</UL>
<P>
Generally in OpenType fonts several Anchor Classes will be treated as one
unit if they refer to approximately the same set of base glyphs and have
non-overlapping marks An example: there could be two types of marks that
attach to the same set of letters, one attaching below and one above the
letter, each would have its own anchor class, but you would tell FontForge
to associate the two together by having them "Merge With" each other.
<P>
FontForge recognizes a special feature tag ' RQD' to indicate that this feature
is required for the given script/language. Such a feature will always be
applied.
<P>
Anchor classes are only meaningful when generating a truetype (ttf or otf)
like font with OpenType tables.<BR Clear=ALL>

  <IMG SRC="fontinfo-context.png" WIDTH="376" HEIGHT="544" ALIGN="Right" ALT="Font Info Contextual Tables">
  <A NAME="Contextual">Contextual</A>

This sub-dialog allows you to create and remove contextual substitutions
and position features in your font.
<P>
For a description of what a contextual feature might be
<A HREF="contextchain.html">see here</A>
<P>
This dialog allows you to create a new contextual feature by pressing the
[New] button. This is a two part operation, first you will be prompted for
the standard tag, script&amp;language combination, and flags, then (in a
<A HREF="contextchain.html">separate dialog</A>) you will be prompted for
the contents of the feature.
<P>
The [Edit] button will allow you to change the tags, script and flags (it
corresponds to the first part of [New]) and the [Edit Data] button allows
you to change the contents of the feature.

Contextual/chaining tables are only meaningful when generating a truetype
(ttf or otf) like font with OpenType tables (in a few cases they can be converted
into Apple Advanced Typography tables too).<BR CLEAR=ALL>

  <A NAME="Mac-Style">Mac Style</A> &amp; FOND
</H2>
<P>
This sub-dialog allows you to set the mac style of your font. Normally FontForge
will be able to guess the style from the fontname (and various other clues),
but sometimes the name will be non-standard (or perhaps just in a language
FontForge doesn't know about), and other times you may wish to override this
default setting.
<P>
If you are happy with the default, just leave the Automatic button checked,
if you wish to override check the button next to the list box. You may select
any combination of styles (remember to hold down the control key to get multiple
selections) except for one containing both "Condense" and "Expand".
<P>
Note: If you want the style to be "Regular" then leave all styles unselected.
<P>
The mac style is stored in the header of an sfnt (truetype or opentype font
file), but is most important in creating mac font families.
<P>
The <A NAME="FONDName">FOND</A> name is only used for generating mac families.
It is a grouping level underneath the family level. See the
