  Font Info

<P>
The Font Info dialog is available from all views. It allows you to name your
font, to set its <A HREF="fontview.html#Encodings">encoding</A> and various
other useful bits of information.
<P>
Postscript fonts have several different names, but basically there are two
important ones: the family name (like times) and the fontname (which is the
family name with a bunch of modifiers like Bold Italic Condensed tacked on
to the end.
<P>
The Italic Angle indicates the slant of the font. PfaEdit can attempt to
guess a good value for you by looking at the stems of certain letters ("I"
for instance).
<P>
The sum of the ascent and descent describes the bounds of the em-square for
the font, and in most postscript fonts will be1000 (this is convention, it
does not need to be 1000), while in most TrueType fonts it will be 2048 (also
a convention, but TrueType claims rasterization is faster if the sum is a
power of 2). Since both TrueType and Type1 (postscript) fonts represent numbers
as 16-bit integers ascent and descent must be less than 32767. TrueType is
more restrictive and requires their sum to be less than 16384.
<P>
The copyright could be whatever you want to put there, but it's a good place
to put a copyright.
<P>
The XUID field is a collection of numbers separated by spaces and enclosed
in brackets. This allows you to specify the extended unique ID of the font.
If you have set the XUID preference entry then PfaEdit will assign values
to all new fonts (by appending a number unique to this font to the end of
your preference item). Adobe recommends that the XUID be changed every time
the font is changed, so each time you generate a postscript font, that font's
XUID (if present) will be incremented by 1.
<P>
You may want to add characters to or removed characters from your font. You
can specify how many characters you want in the font here. <STRONG></STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG> some encodings have different numbers of characters,
and it may be hard to guess how many will be used. But if you have changed
the encoding but not altered the "Number of Characters" box, then the value
in the Number box will be ignored and the correct number will come from the
encoding process.
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
You can also use this dialog to add new encodings to the set that PfaEdit
knows about. There are three buttons that manipulate a set of user defined
encodings. As always these specify both a character set and an encoding.
The encoding has a maximum of 256 entries, but the character set may be larger
(up to 1024). This means that you can define a font with extra characters.
Since postscript fonts can be reencoded at runtime this can be useful.
<P>
The button <CODE>[Load]</CODE> allows you to load an encoding(s) from a file.
Currently the file must either be in the format used by the unicode consortium
for <A HREF="http://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/ISO8859/">mapping ISO
8859</A> encodings to unicode, or it must be a postscript encoding array.
The first format looks like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>0x20	0x0020	#	SPACE
0x21	0x0021	#	EXCLAMATION MARK
...
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
A postscript file looks like:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>/TeXBase1Encoding [
 % 00
 /.notdef /dotaccent /fi /fl
 /fraction /hungarianumlaut /Lslash /lslash
 ...
] def
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
There may be more than one encoding in a postscript file. The encoding parser
is not smart. It will only read arrays specified like this, don't try any
of the innumerable other ways of specifying an array in postscript.
<P>
Here's an <A HREF="Encodings.ps.gz">example of a postscript encoding file</A>.
It contains 3 encodings used by TeX, and one encoding which specifies a character
set that includes all characters in ISO 8859 Latin fonts, and the Adobe Expert
Encoding.
<P>
If the font has a custom encoding then the <CODE>[Make From Font]</CODE>
button is enabled. This allows you to name the encoding you have defined
for the current font.
<P>
The <CODE>[Remove]</CODE> button brings up a list showing all the custom
encodings and allows you to delete them.
