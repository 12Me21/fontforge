<P>
Before you can start fontforge on cygwin you must start the X11 server.
<P>
Open a cygwin window and type
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>$ xinit
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This should create a task window that covers your entire screen, inside of
which there should be an xterm (sort of like the cygwin window earlier).
Be prepared to type commands in this window.

</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <KBD>$ fontforge font.pfa font2.sfd font3.ttf font4.otf </KBD>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
will start fontforge looking at the fonts you specify on the command line.
It can read either pfb or pfa fonts, and some ps fonts (type 0 fonts based
on a type 1 dictionary) as well as truetype fonts, open type fonts and many
other formats.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <KBD>$ fontforge -new</KBD>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
will cause fontforge to create a new font (in iso-8859-1 encoding)
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <KBD>$ fontforge</KBD>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
will open up a file picker dialog and allow you to browse till you've found
a font file (or have created a new one).
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <KBD>$ fontforge -script script.pe fonts...</KBD>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This will invoke fontforge in a non-interactive mode, and have it run the
named script. Any further arguments on the command line will be passed as
arguments to the script and processed (or not) by it.
<P>
For a complete description of possible arguments see <A HREF="cliargs.html">the
section on the command line</A>.

  On the <A NAME="mac">mac</A>
</H3>
<P>
Before you start fontforge on the mac you must start the X11 server. You
can do this by opening the Applications folder, and then opening the Utilities
folder, and then double-clicking on "X11".
<P>
Having done that there should be a menubar with a menu labeled "Applications".
Click on this. There should be a "FontForge" entry in it. Selection FontForge
will start fontforge and bring up a dialog allowing you to open a font or
create a new one.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Caveat: </STRONG></FONT>FontForge does not normally
show mac resource fonts in this dialog -- however it can still open one even
it it isn't displayed. Simply type in the name of the file containing it.
(or, if you prefer, type a "*" in the textfield and then press the [Filter]
button. This should show you all files).
<P>
If the Applications menu does not contain a "FontForge" entry, you can add
one yourself:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Select Applications-&gt;Customize Menu
  <LI>
    Then press the (Add) button in the dialog that appears
  <LI>
    Double click in the left-most section of the blank line which just appeared
    and then type "FontForge"
  <LI>
    Press the [Tab] key and type "/usr/local/bin/fontforge"
  <LI>
    Press the [Tab] key again and type "f"
  <LI>
    Then press (Done)
</UL>
<P>
(You may also start fontforge from the command line here. Go to the Applications
menu and select xterm, and then type <A HREF="running.html#Starting">one
of the commands listed above</A>)
<P>
<FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Caveat: </STRONG></FONT>FontForge does not use
the Command key to invoke menu items. (Any use of the Command key is intercepted
by X11, so Command-Q will quit out of X11 (and abort fontforge), it will
not quit fontforge cleanly)
<P>
<FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Caveat: </STRONG></FONT>FontForge was written assuming
the availability of a three button mouse. X11 simulates this by creating
a virtual three button mouse where the middle button is invoked by Option-Mouse
click and the right button by Command-Mouse click.
