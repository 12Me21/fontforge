  <H3>
    Before starting fontforge on <A NAME="cygwin">cygwin</A>
  </H3>
  <P>
  Before you can start fontforge on cygwin you must start the X11 server.
  <P>
  On recent versions of cygwin this may be done by invoking
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE>C:\cygwin\usr\X11R6\bin\startxwin.bat
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  On older systems:
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    Open a cygwin window and type
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>xinit
</PRE>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>
    This should create a task window that covers your entire screen, inside of
    which there should be an xterm (sort of like the cygwin window earlier).
    Be prepared to type commands in this window.
    <P>
    You should then type
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>twm &amp;
</PRE>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H3>
    Notes on the <A NAME="PATH">PATH</A> variable
  </H3>
  <P>
  On most systems fontforge will install itself into <KBD>/usr/local/bin</KBD>
  (that's the standard place for optional software), and this is not always
  in the default search path for commands (grrrr). Which means you might have
  everything properly installed, but nothing actually works. If you see messages
  like <KBD>"fontforge: command not found."</KBD> this has (probably) happened
  to you.
  <P>
  So what do you do?
  <P>
  You need to set the PATH environment variable so that it includes /usr/local/bin.
  The value of the PATH variable is a set of directories separated by colons.
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>echo $PATH
/home/gww/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/sbin
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  Unfortunately there are four ways of doing this because there are two different
  conventions used by unix shells and then the mac doesn't behave normally
  requiring another two conventions. Type:
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>echo $SHELL
/bin/bash
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  If the name of your shell is <KBD>bash</KBD> (as above), <KBD>ksh</KBD> or
  <KBD>sh</KBD> then you want to type
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH ; export PATH
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  If the name of your shell is <KBD>tcsh</KBD> or <KBD>csh</KBD> then you say
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>setenv PATH /usr/local/bin:$PATH
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  But you'd have to do that every time you logged in. Instead you want this
  included in the shell's initialization. Again there are two cases, for the
  <KBD>bash</KBD> family of shells you want to edit the file
  <KBD>~/.bashrc</KBD> (or <KBD>~/.profile</KBD>) while for the <KBD>csh</KBD>
  family you want to edit the file <KBD>~/.cshrc</KBD> (or
  <KBD>~/.login</KBD>). On a bash system the following command is generally
  sufficient:
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>cat &gt;&gt;~/.bashrc
PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH ; export PATH
^D
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  (where <KBD>^D</KBD> represents control-D, obtained by holding down the control
  key while depressing <KBD>d</KBD>. <BR>
  And for the csh family you would type:
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>cat &gt;&gt;~/.cshrc
setenv PATH /usr/local/bin:$PATH
^D
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  On non-mac systems it is better to use <CODE>~/.profile</CODE> and
  <CODE>~/.login</CODE> rather than the files given above.

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>fontforge font.pfa font2.sfd font3.ttf font4.otf 
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  will start fontforge looking at the fonts you specify on the command line.
  It can read either pfb or pfa fonts, and some ps fonts (type 0 fonts based
  on a type 1 dictionary) as well as truetype fonts, open type fonts and many
  other formats.
  <P>
  <SMALL>(If you get a message from your computer saying: "<KBD>fontforge:

  <A HREF="running.html#PATH">previous section</A>)</SMALL>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>fontforge -new
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  will cause fontforge to create a new font (in iso-8859-1 encoding)
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>fontforge
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  will open up a file picker dialog and allow you to browse till you've found
  a font file (or have created a new one).
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>fontforge -script script.pe fonts...
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  This will invoke fontforge in a non-interactive mode, and have it run the
  named script. Any further arguments on the command line will be passed as
  arguments to the script and processed (or not) by it.
  <P>
  For a complete description of possible arguments see <A HREF="cliargs.html">the
  section on the command line</A>.
  <H3>
    On the <A NAME="mac">mac</A>
  </H3>
  <P>
  Before you start fontforge on the mac you must start the X11 server. You
  can do this by opening the Applications folder, and then opening the Utilities
  folder, and then double-clicking on "X11". (If you don't have X11 there then
  refer back to the <A HREF="mac-install.html#Before">instructions for installing
  it</A>)
  <P>
  Having done that there should be a menubar with a menu labeled "Applications".
  Click on this. There should be a "FontForge" entry in it. Selecting FontForge
  will start fontforge and bring up a dialog allowing you to open a font or
  create a new one.
  <P>
  <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Caveat: </STRONG></FONT>FontForge does not normally
  show mac resource fonts in this dialog -- however it can still open one even
  it it isn't displayed. Simply type in the name of the file containing it.
  (or, if you prefer, type a "*" in the textfield and then press the [Filter]
  button. This should show you all files).
  <P>
  If the Applications menu does not contain a "FontForge" entry, you can add
  one yourself:
  <UL>
    <LI>
      Select Applications-&gt;Customize Menu
    <LI>
      Then press the (Add) button in the dialog that appears
    <LI>
      Double click in the left-most section of the blank line which just appeared
      and then type "FontForge"
    <LI>
      Press the [Tab] key and type "/usr/local/bin/fontforge"
    <LI>
      Press the [Tab] key again and type "f"
    <LI>
      Then press (Done)
  </UL>
  <P>
  (You may also start fontforge from the command line here. Go to the Applications
  menu and select xterm, and then type <A HREF="running.html#Starting">one
  of the commands listed above</A>)
  <P>
  <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Caveat: </STRONG></FONT>FontForge does not use
  the Command key to invoke menu items. (Any use of the Command key is intercepted
  by X11, so Command-Q will quit out of X11 (and abort fontforge), it will
  not quit fontforge cleanly)
  <P>
  <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Caveat: </STRONG></FONT>FontForge was written assuming
  the availability of a three button mouse. X11 simulates this by creating
  a virtual three button mouse where the middle button is invoked by Option-Mouse
  click and the right button by Command-Mouse click.
