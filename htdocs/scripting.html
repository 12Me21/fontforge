  Writing scripts to change fonts in PfaEdit
</H1>
<P>
PfaEdit includes an interpreter so you can write scripts to modify fonts.

<P>
If you start pfaedit with a script on the command line it will not put up
any windows and it will exit when the script is done.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>$ pfaedit -script scriptfile.pe {fontnames}
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
PfaEdit can also be used as an interpreter that the shell will automatically
pass scripts to. If you a mark your script files as executable<BR>
<CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; $ chmod +x scriptfile.pe</CODE><BR>
and begin each one with the line<BR>
<CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; #!/usr/local/bin/pfaedit</CODE><BR>
(or wherever pfaedit happens to reside on your system) then you can invoke
the script just by typing<BR>
<CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; $ scriptfile.pe {fontnames}</CODE>
<P>
If you wish PfaEdit to read from stdin then you can use "-" as a "filename"
for stdin. (If you build PfaEdit without X11 then pfaedit will attempt to
read a script file from <CODE>stdin</CODE> if none is given on the command
line.)
<P>
You can also start a script from within PfaEdit with <CODE>File-&gt;Execute
Script</CODE>, and you can use the Preference Dlg to define a set of frequently
used scripts which can be invoked directly by menu.
<P>
The scripting language provides access to much of the functionality found
in the font view's menus. It does not currently (and probably never will)
provide access to everything. (If you find a lack let me know, I may put
it in for you). It does not provide commands for building up a character
out of splines, instead it allows you to do high level modifications to
characters.
<P>
If you set the environment variable <CODE>PFAEDIT_VERBOSE</CODE> (it doesn't
need a value, just needs to be set) then PfaEdit will print scripts to stdout
as it executes them.
<P>
In general I envision this as being useful for things like taking a latin
font and extending it to contain cyrillic characters. So the script might:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Reencode the font
  <LI>
    Place a reference to Latin "A" at Cyrillic "A"
  <LI>
    Copy Latin "R" to Cyrillic "YA"
  <LI>
    Flip "YA" horizontally
  <LI>
    Correct its direction
  <LI>
    ... and so forth
</UL>
<H2>
  Scripting <A NAME="Language">Language</A>
</H2>
<P>
The syntax is rather like a mixture of C and shell commands. Every file
corresponds to a procedure. As in a shell script arguments passed to the
file are identified as $1, $2, ... $n. $0 is the file name itself. $argc
gives the number of arguments. $argv[&lt;expr&gt;] provides array access
to the arguments.
<P>
Terms can be
<UL>
  <LI>
    A variable name (like "$1" or "i" or "@fontvar" or "_global")<BR>
    The scope of the variable depends on the initial character of its name.
    <UL>
      <LI>
	A '$' signifies that it is a built-in variable. The user cannot create any
	new variables beginning with '$'. Some, but not all, of these may be assigned
	to.
      <LI>
	A '_' signifies that the variable is global, it is always available. You
	can use these to store context across different script files (or to access
	data within nested script files).
      <LI>
	A '@' signifies that the variable is associated with the font. Any two scripts
	looking at the same font will have access to the same variables.
      <LI>
	A variable which begins with a letter is a local variable. It is only meaningful
	within the current script file. Nested script files may have different variables
	with the same names.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    an integer expressed in decimal, hex or octal
  <LI>
    a unicode code point (which has a prefix of "0u" or "0U" and is followed
    by a string of hex digits. This is only used by the select command.
  <LI>
    A string which may be enclosed in either double or single quotes
  <LI>
    a procedure to call or file to invoke.
  <LI>
    an expression within parentheses
</UL>
<P>
There are three different comments supported:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Starting with a "#" character and proceding to end of line
  <LI>
    Starting with "//" and proceding to end of line
  <LI>
    Starting with "/*" and proceding to "*/"
</UL>
<P>
Expressions are similar to those in C, a few operators have been omitted,
a few added from shell scripts. Operator precedence has been simplified slightly.
So operators (and their precedences) are:
<UL>
  <LI>
    unary operators (+, -, !, ~, ++ (prefix and postfix), --(prefix and postfix),
    () (procedure call), [] (array index), :h, :t, :r, :e<BR>
    Most of these are as expected in C, the last four are borrowed from shell
    scripts and are applied to strings
    <UL>
      <LI>
	:h gives the head (directory) of a pathspec
      <LI>
	:t gives the tail (filename) of a pathspec
      <LI>
	:r gives the pathspec without the extension (if any)
      <LI>
	:e gives the extension
    </UL>
  <LI>
    *, /, % (binary multiplicative operators)
  <LI>
    +, - (binary arithmetric operators)<BR>
    If the first operand of + is a string then + will be treated as concatenation
    rather than addition. If the second operand is a number it will be converted
    to a string (decimal representation) and then concatenated.
  <LI>
    ==, !=, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;= (comparison operators, may be applied to
    either two integers or two strings)
  <LI>
    &amp;&amp;, &amp; (logical and, bitwise and. (logical and will do short circuit
    evaluation))
  <LI>
    ||, |, ^ (logical or, bitwise or, bitwise exclusive or (logical or will do
    short circuit evaluation))
  <LI>
    =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %= (assignment operators as in C. The += will act as
    concatenation if the first operand is a string.)
</UL>
<P>
Note there is no comma operator, and no "?:" operator. The precedence of
"and" and "or" has been simplified, as has that of the assignment operators.
<P>
Procedure calls may be applied either to a name token, or to a string. If
the name or string is recognized as one of PfaEdit's internal procedures
it will be executed, otherwise it will be assumed to be a filename containing
another pfaedit script file, this file will be invoked (since filenames can
contain characters not legal in name tokens it is important to allow general
strings to specify filenames). If the procedure name does not contain a directory
then it is assumed to be in the same directory as the current script file.
<P>
Arrays are passed by reference, strings and integers are passed by value.
<P>
Variables may be created by assigning a value to them (only with the "="),
so:<BR>
<CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; i=3</CODE><BR>
could be used to define "i" as a variable. Variables are limited in scope
to the current file, they will not be inherited by called procedures.
<P>
A statement may be
<UL>
  <LI>
    an expression
  <LI>
    <CODE>if ( expression )<BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; statements<BR>
    {elseif ( expression )<BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; statements}<BR>
    [else<BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; statements]<BR>
    endif</CODE>
  <LI>
    <CODE>while ( expression )<BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; statements<BR>
    endloop</CODE>
  <LI>
    <CODE>foreach<BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; statements<BR>
    endloop</CODE>
  <LI>
    <CODE>return [ expression ]</CODE>
  <LI>
    <CODE>shift</CODE>
</UL>
<P>
As with C, non-zero expressions are defined to be true.<BR>
A return statement may be followed by a return value (the expression) or
a procedure may return nothing (void).<BR>
The shift statement is stolen from shell scripts and shifts all arguments
down by one. (argument 0, the name of the script file, remains unchanged.<BR>
The foreach statement requires that there be a current font. It executes
the statements once for each character in the selection. Within the statements
only one character at a time will be selected. After execution the selection
will be restored to what it was initially. (Caveat: Don't reencode the font
within a foreach statement).<BR>
Statements are terminated either by a new line or a semicolon.
<P>
Trivial example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>i=0;	#semicolon is not needed here, but it's ok
while ( i&lt;3 )
   if ( i==1 /* pointless comment */ )
	Print( "Got to one" )	// Another comment
   endif
   ++i
endloop
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
PfaEdit maintains the concept of a "current font" almost all commands refer
only to the current font (and require that there be a font). If you start
a script with File-&gt;Execute Script, the font you were editing will be
current, otherwise there will be no initial current font. The Open(), New()
and Close() commands all change the current font. PfaEdit also maintains
a list of all fonts that are currently open. This list is in no particular
order. The list starts with $firstfont.
<P>
Similarly when working with cid keyed fonts, PfaEdit works in the "current
sub font", and most commands refer to this font. The CIDChangeSubFont() command
can alter that.
<P>
All builtin <A NAME="variables">variables</A> begin with "$", you may not
create any variables that start with "$" yourself (though you may assign
to (some) already existing ones)
<UL>
  <LI>
    <CODE>$0 </CODE>the current script filename
  <LI>
    <CODE>$1 </CODE>the first argument to the script file
  <LI>
    <CODE>$2 </CODE>the second argument to the script file
  <LI>
    ...
  <LI>
    <CODE>$argc</CODE> the number of arguments passed to the script file (this
    will always be at least 1 as $0 is always present)
  <LI>
    <CODE>$argv </CODE>allows you to access the array of all the arguments

    <CODE>$curfont </CODE>the name of the filename in which the current font
    resides
  <LI>
    <CODE>$firstfont </CODE>the name of the filename of the font which is first
    on the font list (Can be used by Open()), if there are no fonts loaded this
    returns an empty string. This can be used to determine if any font at all
    is loaded into pfaedit.
  <LI>
    <CODE>$nextfont </CODE>the name of the filename of the font which follows
    the current font on the list (or the empty string if the current font is
    the last one on the list)
  <LI>
    <CODE>$fontchanged</CODE> returns 1 if the current font has changed, 0 if
    it has not changed since it was read in (or saved).
  <LI>
    <CODE>$fontname</CODE> the name contained in the postscript FontName field
  <LI>
    <CODE>$familyname </CODE>the name contained in the postscript FamilyName
    field

  <LI>
    <CODE>$filename </CODE>the name of the file containing the font.
  <LI>
    <CODE>$cidfontname </CODE>returns the fontname of the top-level cid-keyed
    font (or the empty string if there is none)<BR>
    Can be used to detect if this is a cid keyed font.
  <LI>
    <CODE>$cidfamilyname, $cidfullname, $cidweight, $cidcopyright </CODE>similar
    to above
  <LI>
    <CODE>$italicangle </CODE>the value of the postscript italic angle field
  <LI>
    <CODE>$curcid </CODE>returns the fontname of the current font
  <LI>
    <CODE>$firstcid </CODE>returns the fontname of the first font within this
    cid font
  <LI>
    <CODE>$nextcid </CODE>returns the fontname of the next font within this cid
    font (or the empty string if the current sub-font is the last)
  <LI>
    <CODE>$bitmaps </CODE>returns an array containing all bitmap pixelsizes generated
    for this font. (If the font database contains greymaps then they will be
    indicated in the array as
    <CODE>(&lt;BitmapDepth&gt;&lt;&lt;16)|&lt;PixelSize&gt;</CODE>)
  <LI>
    <CODE>$selection</CODE> returns an array containing one entry for each character
    in the current font indicating whether that character is selected or not
    (0=&gt;not, 1=&gt;selected)
  <LI>
    <CODE>$trace</CODE> if this is set to one then PfaEdit will trace each procedure
    call.
  <LI>
    <CODE>$version</CODE> returns a string containing the current version of
    pfaedit. This should look something like "020817".
  <LI>
    <CODE>$</CODE>&lt;<A NAME="Preference">Preference</A> Item&gt; (for example
    <CODE>$AutoHint</CODE>) allows you to examine the value of that preference
    item (to set it use <CODE><A HREF="#SetPref">SetPref</A></CODE>)
</UL>
<P>
The following example will perform an action on all loaded fonts:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>file = $firstfont
while ( file != "" )
   Open(file)
   /* Do Stuff */
   file = $nextfont
endloop
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The built in <A NAME="procedures">procedures</A> are very similar to the
menu items with the same names.
<DL>
  <DT>
    Print(arg1,arg2,arg3,...)
  <DD>
    This corresponds to no menu item. It will print all of its arguments to stdout.
    It can execute with no current font.
  <DT>
    Error(str)
  <DD>
    Prints out str as an error message and aborts the current script
  <DT>
    AskUser(question[,default-answer])
  <DD>
    Asks the user the question and returns an answer. A default-answer may be
    specified too.
  <DT>
    Array(size)
  <DD>
    Allocates an array of the indicated size.
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <PRE>a = Array(10)
i = 0;
while ( i&lt;10 )
   a[i] = i++
endloop
a[3] = "string"
a[4] = Array(10)
a[4][0] = "Nested array";
</PRE>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <DT>
    Strsub(str,start[,end])
  <DD>
    Returns a substring of the string argument. The substring beings at position
    indexed by start and ends at the position indexed by end (if end is omitted
    the end of the string will be used, the first position is position 0). Thus
    <CODE>Strsub("abcdef",2,3) == "c" </CODE>and <CODE>Strsub("abcdef",2) ==
    "cdef"</CODE>
  <DT>
    Strlen(str)
  <DD>
    Returns the length of the string.
  <DT>
    Strstr(haystack,needle)
  <DD>
    Returns the index of the first occurance of the string needle within the
    string haystack (or -1 if not found).
  <DT>
    Strrstr(haystack,needle)
  <DD>
    Returns the index of the last occurance of the string needle within the string
    haystack (or -1 if not found).
  <DT>
    Strcasestr(haystack,needle)
  <DD>
    Returns the index of the first occurance of the string needle within the
    string haystack ignoring case in the search (or -1 if not found).
  <DT>
    Strcasecmp(str1,str2)
  <DD>
    Compares the two strings ignoring case, returns zero if the two are equal,
    a negative number if str1&lt;str2 and a positive number if str1&gt;str2
  <DT>
    Strtol(str[,base])
  <DD>
    Parses as much of str as possible and returns the integer value it represents.
    A second argument may be used to specify the base of the conversion (it defaults
    to 10). Behavior is as for strtol(3).
  <DT>
    Strskipint(str[,base])
  <DD>
    Parses as much of str as possible and returns the offset to the first character
    that could not be parsed.
  <DT>
    GetPref(str)
  <DD>
    Gets the value of the preference item whose name is contained in str. Only
    boolean, integer, real, string and file preference items may be returned.
    Boolean and real items are returned with integer type and file items are
    returned with string type.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="SetPrefs">SetPrefs</A>(str,val[,val2])
  <DD>
    Sets the value of the preference item whose name is containted in str. If
    the preference item has a real type then a second argument may be passed
    and the value set will be val/val2.
  <DT>
      <HR>
  <DT>
    Open(filename[,flags])
  <DD>
    This makes the font named by filename be the current font. If filename has
    not yet been loaded into memory it will be loaded now. It can execute with
    no current font.<BR>
    When loading from a ttc file, a particular font may be selected by placing
    the fontname in parens and appending it to the filename, as
    <CODE>Open("gulim.ttc(Dotum)")</CODE><BR>
    The optional flags argument current has only one flag in it:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	1 =&gt; the user does have the appropriate lisence to examine the font no
	matter what the fstype setting is.
    </UL>
  <DT>
    New()
  <DD>
    This creates a new font. It can execute with no current font.
  <DT>
    Close()
  <DD>
    This frees up any memory taken up by the current font and drops it off the
    list of loaded fonts. After this executes there will be no current font.
  <DT>
    Save([filename])
  <DD>
    If no filename is specified then this saves the current font back into its
    sfd file (if the font has no sfd file then this is an error). With one argument
    it executes a SaveAs command, saving the current font to that filename.
  <DT>
    Generate(filename[,bitmaptype[,fmflags[,res[,mult-sfd-file]]]])
  <DD>
    Generates a font. The type of font is determined by the extension of the
    filename. Valid extensions are:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	pfa
      <LI>
	pfb
      <LI>
	bin (a mac postscript (pfb) resource in a mac binary wrapper)<BR>
	res (on the Mac itself PfaEdit will put the result directly into a font suitcase
	file, and the extension should be ".res" rather than ".bin")
      <LI>
	mult (splits a big font up into multiple pfb fonts each with 256 characters)
      <LI>
	ps (type 0)
      <LI>
	cid (non-otf cid font)
      <LI>
	ttf
      <LI>
	sym.ttf (a truetype file with a symbol (custom) encoding)
      <LI>
	ttf.bin (a mac truetype resource in a mac binary wrapper)<BR>
	suit (on the Mac itself PfaEdit will put the result directly into a font
	suitcase file, and the extension should be ".suit" not ".ttf.bin")
      <LI>
	dfont (a mac truetype resource in a dfont file)
      <LI>
	otf (either cid or not depending on the font)
      <LI>
	otf.dfont (a mac opentype resource in a dfont file)
    </UL>
    <P>
    If present, bitmaptype may be one of:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	bdf
      <LI>
	ttf (for EBDT/bdat table in truetype/opentype)
      <LI>
	sbit (for EBDT/bdat table in truetype without any outline font)
      <LI>
	bin (for nfnt in macbinary)
      <LI>
	dfont (for nfnt in dfont)
      <LI>
	fnt (For windows FNT format)
      <LI>
	"" for no bitmaps
    </UL>
    <P>
    If you do not wish to generate an outline font then give the filename the
    extension of ".bdf".<BR>
    fmflags controls whether an afm or pfm file should be generated
    <UL>
      <LI>
	-1 =&gt; default (generate an afm file for postscript fonts, never generate
	a pfm file, full 'post' table, ttf hints)
      <LI>
	fmflags&amp;1 =&gt; generate an afm file
      <LI>
	fmflags&amp;2 =&gt; generate a pfm file
      <LI>
	fmflags&amp;4 =&gt; generate a short 'post' table with no character name
	info in it.
      <LI>
	fmflags&amp;8 =&gt; generate ttf hints (PfaEdit does a bad job here (currently),
	you may want this off)
      <LI>
	fmflags&amp;16 =&gt; where apple and ms/adobe differ about the format of
	a true/open type file, use apple's definition (otherwise use ms/adobe)<BR>
	Currently this affects bitmaps stored in the font (Apple calls the table
	'bdat', ms/adobe 'EBDT'), the PostScript name in the 'name' table (Apple
	says it must occur exactly once, ms/adobe say at least twice), and whether
	morx/feat/kern/opbd/prop/lcar or GSUB/GPOS/GDEF tables are generated.
    </UL>
    <P>
    res controls the resolution of generated bdf fonts. A value of -1 means pfaedit
    will guess for each strike.
    <P>
    If the filename has a ".mult" extension then a "mult-sfd-file" may be present.
    This is the filename of a file containing the mapping from the current encoding
    into the subfonts. <A HREF="Big5.txt">Here is an example</A>. If this file
    is not present PfaEdit will go through its default search process to find
    a file for the encoding, and if it fails the fonts will not be saved.
  <DT>
    GenerateFamily(filename,bitmaptype,fmflags,array-of-font-filenames)
  <DD>
    Generates a mac font family (FOND) the fonts (which must be loaded) in the
    array-of-font-filenames. filename, bitmaptype, fmflags are as above.

  <DT>
    Import
  <DD>
    Either imports a bitmap font into the database, or imports background image[s]
    into various characters. There may be one or two arguments. The first must
    be a string representing a filename. The extension of the file determines
    how the import procedes. If present the second argument must be an integer,
    if the first argument is a bitmap font then the second argument controls
    whether it is imported into the bitmap list (0) or to fill up the backgrounds
    of characters (1).
    <UL>
      <LI>
	If the extension is ".bdf" then a bdf font will be imported
      <LI>
	If the extension is ".pcf" then a pcf font will be imported.
      <LI>
	If the extension is ".ttf" then the EBDT or bdat table of the ttf file will
	be searched for bitmap fonts
      <LI>
	If the extension is "pk" then a metafont pk (bitmap font) file will be import
	and by default placed in the background
      <LI>
	Otherwise if the extension is an image extension, and any loaded images will
	be placed in the background.
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    If the filename contains a "*" then it should be a recognized template in
	    which case all images which match that template will be loaded appropriately
	    and stored in the background
	  <LI>
	    Otherwise there may be several filenames (seperated by semicolons), the first
	    will be placed in the background of the first selected character, the second
	    into the background of the second selected character, ...
	</UL>
      <LI>
	Finally if the extension is "eps" then an encapsulated postscript file will
	be merged into the foreground. The file may be specified as for images (except
	the extension should be "eps" rather than an image extension). PfaEdit is
	very limitted in its ability to read eps files.
    </UL>
  <DT>
    Export(format[,bitmap-size])
  <DD>
    For each selected character in the current font, this command will export

      <LI>
	xbm -- The second argument specifies a bitmap font size, the selected characters
	in that bitmap font will be output as xbm files. The files will be named
	"&lt;glyph-name&gt;_&lt;font-name&gt;.xbm".
      <LI>
	bmp -- The second argument specifies a bitmap font size, the selected characters

    the current font.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="PrintSetup">PrintSetup</A>(type,[printer[,width,height]])
  <DD>
    Allows you to configure the print command. Type may be a value between 0
    and 4
    <UL>
      <LI>
	0 =&gt; print with lp
      <LI>
	1 =&gt; print with lpr

	3 =&gt; output to file
      <LI>
	4 =&gt; other printing command
    </UL>
    <P>
    If the type is 4 (other) and the second argument is specified, then the second
    argument should be a string containing the "other" printing command.<BR>
    If the type is 0 (lp) or 1 (lpr) and the second argument is specified, then
    the second argument should contain the name of a laser printer<BR>
    (If the second argument is a null string neither will be set).
    <P>
    The third and fourth arguments should specify the page width and height
    respectively. Units are in points, so 8.5x11" paper is 612,792 and A4 paper
    is (about) 595,842.
  <DT>
    PrintFont(type[,pointsize[,sample-text-file[,output-file]]])
  <DD>
    Prints the current font according to the

	2 =&gt; Prints selected characters at multiple pointsizes
      <LI>
	3 =&gt; Prints a text sample at the given pointsize(s)
    </UL>
    <P>
    The pointsize is either a single integer or an array of integers. It is only
    meaningful for types 0 and 3. If omitted or set to 0 a default value will
    be chosen. The font display will only look at one value.
    <P>
    If you selected print type 3 then you may provide the name of a file containing
    sample text. This file may either be in ucs2 format (preceded by a 0xfeff
    value), or in the current default encoding. A null string or an omitted argument
    will cause PfaEdit to use a default value.
    <P>
    If your PrintSetup specified printing to a file then the fourth argument
    provides the filename of the output file.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Quit">Quit</A>(status)

  <DT>
    Select(arg1, arg2, ...)
  <DD>
    This clears out the current selection, then for each pair of arguments it
    selects all characters between (inclusive) the bounds specified by the pair.
    If there is a final singleton argument then that single character will be
    selected. An argument may be specified by:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	an integer which specifies the location in the current font's encoding
      <LI>
	a postscript unicode name which gets mapped into the current font's encoding
      <LI>
	a unicode code point (0u61) which gets mapped to the current font's encoding
      <LI>
	If Select is given exactly one argument and that argument is an array then
	the selection will be set to that specified in the array. So array[0] would
	set the selection of the character at encoding 0 and so forth. The array
	may have a different number of elements from that number of characters in
	the font.
    </UL>
  <DT>
    SelectMore(arg1, arg2, ...)
  <DD>
    The same as the previous command except that it does not clear the selection,

    Sets the number of characters in the font.
  <DT>
    SetFontNames(fontname[,family[,fullname[,weight[,copyright-notice]]]])

    Sets various postscript names associated with a font. If a name is omitted
    (or is the empty string) it will not be changed.
  <DT>
    SetItalicAngle(angle[,denom])
  <DD>
    Sets the postscript italic angle field appropriately. If denom is specified
    then angle will be divided by denom before setting the italic angle field
    (a hack to get real values). The angle should be in degrees.
  <DT>
    SetUniqueID(value)
  <DD>
    Sets the postscript uniqueid field as requested. If you give a value of 0
    then PfaEdit will pick a reasonable random number for you.
  <DT>
    SetCharName(name[,set-from-name-flag])
  <DD>
    Sets the currently selected character to have the given name. If
    set-from-name-flag is absent or is present and true then it will also set
    the unicode value and the ligature string to match the name.
  <DT>
    SetUnicodeValue(uni[,set-from-value-flag])
  <DD>
    Sets the currently selected character to have the given unicode value. If
    set-from-value-flag is absent or is present and true then it will also set
    the name and the ligature string to match the value.
  <DT>
    SetCharColor(color)
  <DD>
    Sets any currently selected characters to have the given color (expressed
    as 24 bit rgb (0xff0000 is red) with the special value of -2 meaning the
    default color.
  <DT>
    SetCharComment(comment)
  <DD>
    Sets the currently selected character to have the given comment. The comment
    is converted via the current encoding to unicode.
  <DT>
    BitmapsAvail(sizes)
  <DD>
    Controls what bitmap sizes are stored in the font's database. It is passed
    an array of sizes. If a size is specified which is not in the font database
    it will be generated. If a size is not specified which is in the font database
    it will be removed. A size which is specifed and present in the font database
    will not be touched.<BR>
    If you want to specify greymap fonts then the low-order 16 bits will be the
    pixel size and the high order 16 bits will specify the bits/pixel. Thus 0x8000c
    would be a 12 pixel font with 8 bits per pixel, while either 0xc or 0x1000c
    could be used to refer to a 12 pixel bitmap font.
  <DT>
    BitmapsRegen(sizes)
  <DD>
    Allows you to update specific bitmaps in an already generated bitmap font.
    It will regenerate the bitmaps of all selected characters at the specified
    pixelsizes.
  <DT>

  <DT>
    VFlip([about-y])
  <DD>
    All selected characters will be vertically flipped about the horizontal line
    through y=about-y. If no argument is given then all selected characters will
    be flipped about their central point.
  <DT>
    Rotate(angle[,ox,oy])
  <DD>
    Rotates all selected character the specified number of degrees. If the last
    two args are specified they provide the origin of the rotation, otherwise
    the center of the character is used.
  <DT>
    Scale(factor[,yfactor][,ox,oy])
  <DD>
    All selected characters will be scaled (scale factors are in percent)
    <UL>
      <LI>
	with one argument they will be scaled uniformly about the character's center
	point
      <LI>
	with two arguments the first specifies the scale factor for x, the second
	for y. Again scaling will be about the center point
      <LI>
	with three arguments they will be scaled uniformly about the specified center
      <LI>
	with four arguments they will be scaled differently about the specified center
    </UL>

    be in the same proportion to the new em (which is the sum of ascent and descent)
    value that it was to the old value.
  <DT>
    ExpandStroke(width)<BR>
    ExpandStroke(width,line cap, line join)<BR>
    ExpandStroke(width,caligraphic-angle,height-numerator,height-denom)
  <DD>
    In the first format a line cap of "butt" and line join of "round" are implied..
  <DT>
    RemoveOverlap()
  <DD>
    Does the obvious.
  <DT>
    Simplify()<BR>
    Simplify(flags,error)
  <DD>
    With no arguments it does the obvious. If flags is -1 it does a Cleanup,
    otherwise flags should be a bitwise or of
    <UL>
      <LI>
	1 -- Slopes may change at the end points.
      <LI>
	2 -- Points which are extremum may be removed

    MergeFonts(other-font-name[,flags])
  <DD>
    Loads other-font-name, and extracts any characters from it which are not
    in the current font and moves them to the current font. The flags argument
    is the same as that for Open. Currently the only relevant flag is to say
    that you do have a lisence to use a font with fstype=2.

  <DT>
    CenterInWidth()
  <DD>
  <DT>
    AutoWidth(spacing)
  <DD>
    Guesses at the widths of all selected characters so that two adjacent "I"
    characters will appear to be spacing em-units apart. (if spacing is the negative
    of the em-size (sum of ascent and descent) then a default value will be used).
  <DT>
    AutoKern(spacing,threshold[,kernfile])
  <DD>
    (AutoKern doesn't work well in general)<BR>

    CIDSetFontNames(fontname[,family[,fullname[,weight[,copyright-notice]]]])
  <DD>
    Sets various postscript names associated with the top level cid font. If

  The <A NAME="Execute">Execute</A> Script dialog
</H2>
<P>
This dialog allows you to type a script directly in to PfaEdit and then run
it. Of course the most common case is that you'll have a script file somewhere
that you want to execute, so there's a button [Call] down at the bottom of
the dlg. Pressing [Call] will bring up a file picker dlg looking for files
with the extension *.pe (you can change that by typing a wildcard sequence
and pressing the [Filter] button). After you have selected your scipt the
appropriate text to text to invoke it will be placed in the text area.
<P>
The current font of the script will be set to whatever font you invoked it
from.
<H2>
  The Scripts <A NAME="menu">Menu</A>

<P>
You can use the preference dialog to create a list of frequently used scripts.
Invoke <A HREF="prefs.html#scripts">File-&gt;Preferences</A> and select the
Scripts tag. In this dialog are ten possible entries, each one should have
a name (to be displayed in the menu) and an associated script file to be
run.
<P>
After you have set up your preferences you can invoke scripts from the font
view, either directly from the menu (File-&gt;Scripts-&gt;&lt;your name&gt;)
or by a hot key. The first script you added will be invoked by Cnt-Alt-1,
then second by Cnt-Alt-2, and the tenth by Cnt-Alt-0.
