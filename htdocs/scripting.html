  Writing scripts to change fonts in FontForge
</H1>
<P>
FontForge includes an interpreter so you can write scripts to modify fonts.

<H2>
  <A NAME="Starting">Starting scripts</A>
</H2>
<P>
If you start fontforge with a script on the command line it will not put
up any windows and it will exit when the script is done.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>$ fontforge -script scriptfile.pe {fontnames}
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
FontForge can also be used as an interpreter that the shell will automatically
pass scripts to. If you a mark your script files as executable<BR>
<CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; $ chmod +x scriptfile.pe</CODE><BR>
and begin each one with the line<BR>
<CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; #!/usr/local/bin/fontforge</CODE><BR>
(or wherever fontforge happens to reside on your system) then you can invoke
the script just by typing<BR>
<CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; $ scriptfile.pe {fontnames}</CODE>
<P>
If you wish FontForge to read a script from stdin then you can use "-" as
a "filename" for stdin. (If you build FontForge without X11 then fontforge
will attempt to read a script file from <CODE>stdin</CODE> if none is given
on the command line.)
<P>
You can also start a script from within FontForge with
<CODE>File-&gt;Execute Script</CODE>, and you can use the Preference Dlg
to define a set of frequently used scripts which can be invoked directly
by menu.
<P>
The scripting language provides access to much of the functionality found
in the font view's menus. It does not currently (and probably never will)
provide access to everything. (If you find a lack let me know, I may put
it in for you). It does not provide commands for building up a glyph out
of splines, instead it allows you to do high level modifications to glyphs.
<P>
If you set the environment variable <CODE>PFAEDIT_VERBOSE</CODE> (it doesn't
need a value, just needs to be set) then FontForge will print scripts to
stdout as it executes them.
<P>
In general I envision this as being useful for things like taking a latin
font and extending it to contain cyrillic glyphs. So the script might:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Reencode the font
  <LI>
    Place a reference to Latin "A" at Cyrillic "A"
  <LI>
    Copy Latin "R" to Cyrillic "YA"
  <LI>
    Flip "YA" horizontally
  <LI>
    Correct its direction
  <LI>
    ... and so forth
</UL>
<H2>
  Scripting <A NAME="Language">Language</A>
</H2>
<P>
The syntax is rather like a mixture of C and shell commands. Every file
corresponds to a procedure. As in a shell script arguments passed to the
file are identified as $1, $2, ... $n. $0 is the file name itself. $argc
gives the number of arguments. $argv[&lt;expr&gt;] provides array access
to the arguments.
<P>
Terms can be
<UL>
  <LI>
    A variable name (like "$1" or "i" or "@fontvar" or "_global")<BR>
    The scope of the variable depends on the initial character of its name.
    <UL>
      <LI>
	A '$' signifies that it is a built-in variable. The user cannot create any
	new variables beginning with '$'. Some, but not all, of these may be assigned
	to.
      <LI>
	A '_' signifies that the variable is global, it is always available. You
	can use these to store context across different script files (or to access
	data within nested script files).
      <LI>
	A '@' signifies that the variable is associated with the font. Any two scripts
	looking at the same font will have access to the same variables.
      <LI>
	A variable which begins with a letter is a local variable. It is only meaningful
	within the current script file. Nested script files may have different variables
	with the same names.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    an integer expressed in decimal, hex or octal
  <LI>
    a unicode code point (which has a prefix of "0u" or "0U" and is followed
    by a string of hex digits. This is only used by the select command.
  <LI>
    a real number (in "C" locale format -- "." as the decimal point character)
  <LI>
    A string which may be enclosed in either double or single quotes
  <LI>
    a procedure to call or file to invoke.
  <LI>
    an expression within parentheses
</UL>
<P>
There are three different comments supported:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Starting with a "#" character and proceeding to end of line
  <LI>
    Starting with "//" and proceeding to end of line
  <LI>
    Starting with "/*" and proceeding to "*/"
</UL>
<P>
Expressions are similar to those in C, a few operators have been omitted,
a few added from shell scripts. Operator precedence has been simplified slightly.
So operators (and their precedences) are:
<UL>
  <LI>
    unary operators (+, -, !, ~, ++ (prefix and postfix), --(prefix and postfix),
    () (procedure call), [] (array index), :h, :t, :r, :e<BR>
    Most of these are as expected in C, the last four are borrowed from shell
    scripts and are applied to strings
    <UL>
      <LI>
	:h gives the head (directory) of a pathspec
      <LI>
	:t gives the tail (filename) of a pathspec
      <LI>
	:r gives the pathspec without the extension (if any)
      <LI>
	:e gives the extension
    </UL>
  <LI>
    *, /, % (binary multiplicative operators)
  <LI>
    +, - (binary arithmetic operators)<BR>
    If the first operand of + is a string then + will be treated as concatenation
    rather than addition. If the second operand is a number it will be converted
    to a string (decimal representation) and then concatenated.
  <LI>
    ==, !=, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;= (comparison operators, may be applied to
    either two integers or two strings)
  <LI>
    &amp;&amp;, &amp; (logical and, bitwise and. (logical and will do short circuit
    evaluation))
  <LI>
    ||, |, ^ (logical or, bitwise or, bitwise exclusive or (logical or will do
    short circuit evaluation))
  <LI>
    =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %= (assignment operators as in C. The += will act as
    concatenation if the first operand is a string.)
</UL>
<P>
Note there is no comma operator, and no "?:" operator. The precedence of
"and" and "or" has been simplified, as has that of the assignment operators.
<P>
Procedure calls may be applied either to a name token, or to a string. If
the name or string is recognized as one of FontForge's internal procedures
it will be executed, otherwise it will be assumed to be a filename containing
another fontforge script file, this file will be invoked (since filenames
can contain characters not legal in name tokens it is important to allow
general strings to specify filenames). If the procedure name does not contain
a directory then it is assumed to be in the same directory as the current
script file. At most 25 arguments can be passed to a procedure.
<P>
Arrays are passed by reference, strings and integers are passed by value.
<P>
Variables may be created by assigning a value to them (only with the "="),
so:<BR>
<CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; i=3</CODE><BR>
could be used to define "i" as a variable. Variables are limited in scope
to the current file, they will not be inherited by called procedures.
<P>
A statement may be
<UL>
  <LI>
    an expression
  <LI>
    <CODE>if ( expression )<BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; statements<BR>
    {elseif ( expression )<BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; statements}<BR>
    [else<BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; statements]<BR>
    endif</CODE>
  <LI>
    <CODE>while ( expression )<BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; statements<BR>
    endloop</CODE>
  <LI>
    <CODE>foreach<BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; statements<BR>
    endloop</CODE>
  <LI>
    <CODE>return [ expression ]</CODE>
  <LI>
    <CODE>shift</CODE>
</UL>
<P>
As with C, non-zero expressions are defined to be true.<BR>
A return statement may be followed by a return value (the expression) or
a procedure may return nothing (void).<BR>
The shift statement is stolen from shell scripts and shifts all arguments
down by one. (argument 0, the name of the script file, remains unchanged.<BR>
The foreach statement requires that there be a current font. It executes
the statements once for each glyph in the selection. Within the statements
only one glyph at a time will be selected. After execution the selection
will be restored to what it was initially. (Caveat: Don't reencode the font
within a foreach statement).<BR>
Statements are terminated either by a new line (you can break up long lnes
with backslash newline) or a semicolon.
<P>
Trivial example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>i=0;	#semicolon is not needed here, but it's ok
while ( i&lt;3 )
   if ( i==1 /* pointless comment */ )
	Print( "Got to one" )	// Another comment
   endif
   ++i
endloop
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
FontForge maintains the concept of a "current font"-- almost all commands
refer only to the current font (and require that there be a font). If you
start a script with File-&gt;Execute Script, the font you were editing will
be current, otherwise there will be no initial current font. The Open(),
New() and Close() commands all change the current font. FontForge also maintains
a list of all fonts that are currently open. This list is in no particular
order. The list starts with $firstfont.
<P>
Similarly when working with cid keyed fonts, FontForge works in the "current
sub font", and most commands refer to this font. The CIDChangeSubFont() command
can alter that.
<P>
All builtin <A NAME="variables">variables</A> begin with "$", you may not
create any variables that start with "$" yourself (though you may assign
to (some) already existing ones)
<UL>
  <LI>
    <CODE>$0 </CODE>the current script filename
  <LI>
    <CODE>$1 </CODE>the first argument to the script file
  <LI>
    <CODE>$2 </CODE>the second argument to the script file
  <LI>
    ...
  <LI>
    <CODE>$argc</CODE> the number of arguments passed to the script file (this

    <CODE>$firstfont </CODE>the name of the filename of the font which is first
    on the font list (Can be used by Open()), if there are no fonts loaded this
    returns an empty string. This can be used to determine if any font at all
    is loaded into fontforge.

    font (or the empty string if there is none)<BR>
    Can be used to detect if this is a cid keyed font.
  <LI>
    <CODE>$cidfamilyname, $cidfullname, $cidweight, $cidcopyright </CODE>similar
    to above
  <LI>
    <CODE>$mmcount </CODE>returns 0 for non multiple master fonts, returns the
    number of instances in a multiple master font.
  <LI>
    <CODE>$italicangle </CODE>the value of the postscript italic angle field
  <LI>
    <CODE>$curcid </CODE>returns the fontname of the current font

    bits indicating whether the font is bold, italic, condensed, etc.)
  <LI>
    <CODE>$bitmaps </CODE>returns an array containing all bitmap pixelsizes generated
    for this font. (If the font database contains greymaps then they will be
    indicated in the array as
    <CODE>(&lt;BitmapDepth&gt;&lt;&lt;16)|&lt;PixelSize&gt;</CODE>)
  <LI>
    <CODE>$selection</CODE> returns an array containing one entry for each glyph
    in the current font indicating whether that glyph is selected or not
    (0=&gt;not, 1=&gt;selected)
  <LI>
    <CODE>$panose</CODE> returns an array containing the 10 panose values for
    the font.
  <LI>
    <CODE>$trace</CODE> if this is set to one then FontForge will trace each
    procedure call.
  <LI>
    <CODE>$version</CODE> returns a string containing the current version of
    fontforge. This should look something like "020817".
  <LI>
    <CODE>$</CODE>&lt;<A NAME="Preference">Preference</A> Item&gt; (for example
    <CODE>$AutoHint</CODE>) allows you to examine the value of that preference
    item (to set it use <CODE><A HREF="#SetPref">SetPref</A></CODE>)
</UL>
<P>
The following example will perform an action on all loaded fonts:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>file = $firstfont
while ( file != "" )
   Open(file)
   /* Do Stuff */
   file = $nextfont
endloop
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The built in <A NAME="procedures">procedures</A> are very similar to the
menu items with the same names. Often the description here is sketchy, look
at the menu item for more information.
<DL>
  <DT>
    Print(arg1,arg2,arg3,...)
  <DD>
    This corresponds to no menu item. It will print all of its arguments to stdout.
    It can execute with no current font.
  <DT>
    PostNotice(str)
  <DD>
    When run from the UI will put up a window displaying the string (the window
    will not block the program and will disappear after a minute or so). When
    run from the command line will write the string to stderr.
  <DT>
    Error(str)
  <DD>
    Prints out str as an error message and aborts the current script
  <DT>
    AskUser(question[,default-answer])
  <DD>
    Asks the user the question and returns an answer (a string). A default-answer
    may be specified too.
  <DT>
    Array(size)
  <DD>
    Allocates an array of the indicated size.
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <PRE>a = Array(10)
i = 0;
while ( i&lt;10 )
   a[i] = i++
endloop
a[3] = "string"
a[4] = Array(10)
a[4][0] = "Nested array";
</PRE>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <DT>
    SizeOf(arr)
  <DD>
    Returns the number of elements in an array.
  <DT>
    TypeOf(any)
  <DD>
    Returns a string naming the type of the argument:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	"Integer"
      <LI>
	"Real"
      <LI>
	"Unicode"
      <LI>
	"String"
      <LI>
	"Array"
      <LI>
	"Void"<BR>
	(The following type is used internally, but I don't think the user can ever
	see it. It is included here for completeness)
      <LI>
	"LValue"
    </UL>
  <DT>
    Strsub(str,start[,end])
  <DD>
    Returns a substring of the string argument. The substring begins at position
    indexed by start and ends before the position indexed by end (if end is omitted
    the end of the string will be used, the first position is position 0). Thus
    <CODE>Strsub("abcdef",2,3) == "c" </CODE>and <CODE>Strsub("abcdef",2) ==
    "cdef"</CODE>
  <DT>
    Strlen(str)
  <DD>
    Returns the length of the string.
  <DT>
    Strstr(haystack,needle)
  <DD>
    Returns the index of the first occurrence of the string needle within the
    string haystack (or -1 if not found).
  <DT>
    Strrstr(haystack,needle)
  <DD>
    Returns the index of the last occurrence of the string needle within the
    string haystack (or -1 if not found).
  <DT>
    Strcasestr(haystack,needle)
  <DD>
    Returns the index of the first occurrence of the string needle within the
    string haystack ignoring case in the search (or -1 if not found).
  <DT>
    Strcasecmp(str1,str2)
  <DD>
    Compares the two strings ignoring case, returns zero if the two are equal,
    a negative number if str1&lt;str2 and a positive number if str1&gt;str2
  <DT>
    Strtol(str[,base])
  <DD>
    Parses as much of str as possible and returns the integer value it represents.
    A second argument may be used to specify the base of the conversion (it defaults
    to 10). Behavior is as for strtol(3).
  <DT>
    Strskipint(str[,base])
  <DD>
    Parses as much of str as possible and returns the offset to the first character
    that could not be parsed.
  <DT>
    Strtod(str)
  <DD>
    Converts a string to a real number.
  <DT>
    LoadPrefs()
  <DD>
    Loads the user's preferences. This used to happen automatically at startup.
    Now it happens automatically when the UI is started, but scripts must request
    it.
  <DT>
    SavePrefs()
  <DD>
    Save the current state of preferences. This used to happen when SetPref was
    called, now a script must request it explicitly.
  <DT>
    GetPref(str)
  <DD>
    Gets the value of the preference item whose name is contained in str. Only
    boolean, integer, real, string and file preference items may be returned.
    Boolean and real items are returned with integer type and file items are
    returned with string type. Encodings (NewCharset) are returned as magic numbers,
    these are meaningless outside the context of get/set Pref.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="SetPrefs">SetPrefs</A>(str,val[,val2])
  <DD>
    Sets the value of the preference item whose name is contained in str. If
    the preference item has a real type then a second argument may be passed
    and the value set will be val/val2.
  <DT>
    DefaultOtherSubrs()
  <DD>
    Returns to using Adobe's versions of the OtherSubrs subroutines.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="ReadOtherSubrsFile">ReadOtherSubrsFile</A>(filename)
  <DD>
    Reads new PostScript subroutines to be used in the OtherSubrs array of a
    type1 font. The file format is a little more complicated than it should be
    (because I can't figure out how to parse the OtherSubrs array into individual
    subroutines).
    <UL>
      <LI>
	The subroutine list should not be enclosed in a [ ] pair
      <LI>
	Each subroutine should be preceded by a line starting with '%%%%' (there
	may be more stuff after that)
      <LI>
	Subroutines should come in the obvious order, and must have the expected
	meaning.
      <LI>
	If you don't wish to support flex hints set the first three subroutines to
	"{}"
      <LI>
	You may specify at most 14 subroutines (0-13)
      <LI>
	Any text before the first subroutine will be treated as a copyright notice.
    </UL>

    GetEnv(str)
  <DD>
    Returns the value of the unix environment variable named by str.
  <DT>
    FileAccess(filename[,prot])
  <DD>
    Behaves like the unix access system call. Returns 0 if the file exists, -1
    if it does not. If protection is omitted, checks for read access.
  <DT>
    UnicodeFromName(name)
  <DD>
    Looks the string "name" up in FontForge's database of commonly used glyph
    names and returns the unicode value associated with that name, or -1 if not
    found. This does <EM>not</EM> check the current font (if any).
  <DT>
    Chr(int)<BR>
    Chr(array)
  <DD>
    Takes an integer [0,255] and returns a single character string containing
    that code point. Internally FontForge interprets strings as if they were
    in utf8 (well really, FontForge almost always just uses ASCII-US internally).
    If passed an array, it should be an array of integers and the result is the
    string.
  <DT>
    Ord(string[,pos])
  <DD>
    Returns an array of integers representing the encoding of the characters
    in the string. If pos is given it should be an integer less than the string
    length and the function will return the integer encoding of that character
    in the string.
  <DT>
    Real(int)
  <DD>
    Converts an integer to a real number.
  <DT>
    Round(real)
  <DD>
    Converts a real number to an integer by rounding to the nearest integer
  <DT>
    Floor(real)
  <DD>
    Converts a real number to the largest integer smaller than the real.
  <DT>
    Ceil(real)
  <DD>
    Converts a real number to the smallest integer larger than the real.
  <DT>
    Int(real)
  <DD>
    Uses standard C conversion from real to integer.
  <DT>
    UCodePoint(int)
  <DD>
    Converts the argument to a unicode code point (a special type used in several
    commands).
  <DT>
    ToString(arg)
  <DD>
    Converts its argument to a string. (the output is what the Print() command
    would print)
  <DT>
    IsNan(real)
  <DD>
    Returns whether the value is a nan.
  <DT>
    IsFinite(real)
  <DD>
    Returns whether the value is finite (not infinite and not a nan).
  <DT>
    Sqrt(val)
  <DD>
    Returns the square root
  <DT>
    Exp(val)
  <DD>
    Returns e^val
  <DT>
    Log(val)
  <DD>
    Returns the natural log of val.
  <DT>
    Pow(val1,val2)
  <DD>
    Returns val1^val2
  <DT>
    Sin(val)
  <DD>
    Returns the sine of val
  <DT>

    Returns the cosine of val
  <DT>
    Tan(val)
  <DD>
    Returns the tangent of val
  <DT>
    ATan2(val1,val2)
  <DD>
    Returns the arc-tangent. See atan2(3) for more info.
  <DT>
    Utf8(int)
  <DD>
    Takes an integer [0,0x10ffff] and returns the utf8 string representing that
    unicode code point. If passed an array of integers it will generate a utf8
    string containing all of those unicode code points. (it does not expect to
    get surrogates).
  <DT>
    Rand()
  <DD>
    returns a random integer
  <DT>
      <HR>
  <DT>
    FontsInFile(filename)
  <DD>
    Returns an array of strings containing the names of all fonts within a file.
    Most files contain one font, but some (mac font suitcases, dfonts, ttc files,
    svg files, etc) may contain several. If the file contains no fonts (or the
    file doesn't exist, or the fonts aren't named), a zero length array is returned.
    It does not open the font. It can execute without a current font.
  <DT>
    <A HREF="filemenu.html#Open">Open</A>(filename[,flags])
  <DD>
    This makes the font named by filename be the current font. If filename has
    not yet been loaded into memory it will be loaded now. It can execute without
    a current font.<BR>
    When loading from a ttc file (mac suitcase, dfont, svg, etc), a particular
    font may be selected by placing the fontname in parens and appending it to
    the filename, as <CODE>Open("gulim.ttc(Dotum)")</CODE><BR>
    The optional flags argument current has only one flag in it:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	1 =&gt; the user does have the appropriate license to examine the font no
	matter what the fstype setting is.
    </UL>
  <DT>
    <A HREF="filemenu.html#New">New</A>()
  <DD>
    This creates a new font. It can execute with no current font.
  <DT>
    Close()
  <DD>
    This frees up any memory taken up by the current font and drops it off the
    list of loaded fonts. After this executes there will be no current font.
  <DT>
    <A HREF="filemenu.html#Save">Save</A>([filename])
  <DD>
    If no filename is specified then this saves the current font back into its
    sfd file (if the font has no sfd file then this is an error). With one argument
    it executes a SaveAs command, saving the current font to that filename.
  <DT>
    <A HREF="filemenu.html#Generate">Generate</A>(filename[,bitmaptype[,fmflags[,res[,mult-sfd-file]]]])
  <DD>
    Generates a font. The type of font is determined by the extension of the

      <LI>
	.pfa
      <LI>
	.pfb
      <LI>
	.bin (a mac postscript (pfb) resource in a mac binary wrapper)<BR>
	.res (on the Mac itself FontForge will put the result directly into a font
	suitcase file, and the extension should be ".res" rather than ".bin")
	<P>
	Note: you must also create a bitmap font in NFNT format or the mac will not
	recognize your postscript font.
      <LI>
	*%s*.pf[ab] (here more than just an extension is required, the font name
	must contain a "%s") (splits a big font up into multiple pfb fonts each with
	256 characters, making use of the fifth argument to determine how this is
	done). The "%s" will be replaced by the fontnumber specified in the
	mult-sfd-file.
      <LI>
	.mm.pfa (multiple master font in ascii format)

	<P>
	NOTE: Mac OS/X does not appear to support NFNT bitmaps. However even though
	unused itself, an NFNT bitmap must be present for a resource based type1
	postscript font to be used. (More accurately the obsolete FOND must be present,

    </UL>
    <P>
    Note: If you request bitmap output then all strikes in the current font database
    will be output, but this command will not create bitmaps, so if there are
    no strikes in your font database, no strikes will be output (even if you
    ask for them). If you wish to output bitmaps you must first create them with

    TeX-Base-Encoding, one of the user defined encodings.<BR>
    You may also specify that you want to force the encoding to be the given
    one.<BR>
    Note: some encodings are specified by glyph names (ie. user defined encodings
    specified as postscript encoding arrays) others are specified as lists of
    unicode code points (most built in encodings except for AdobeStandard and
    TeX, user defined encodings specified by codepoints). If you reencode to
    an encoding defined by glyph names, then ff will first move glyphs to the
    appropriate slots, and then force any glyphs with the wrong name to have
    the correct one. The most obvious example of this is the fi ligature:
    AdobeStandard says it should be named "fi", modern fonts tend to call it
    "f_i". Reencoding to AdobeStandard will move this glyph to the right slot,
    and then name it "fi".

    Sets the TeX (text) font parameters for the font.<BR>
    Type may be 1, 2 or 3, depending on whether the font is text, math or math
    extension. <BR>
    DesignSize is the pointsize the font was designed for.<BR>
    The remaining parameters are described in Knuth's The MetaFont Book, pp.
    98-100.<BR>
    Slant is expressed as a percentage. All the others are expressed in
    em-units.<BR>
    If type is 1 then the 9 indicated arguments are required. If type is 2 then
    24 arguments are required (the remaining 15 are described in the metafont
    book). If type is 3 then 15 arguments are required.

  <DD>
    Controls what bitmap sizes are stored in the font's database. It is passed
    an array of sizes. If a size is specified which is not in the font database
    it will be generated. If a size is not specified which is in the font database
    it will be removed. A size which is specified and present in the font database
    will not be touched.<BR>
    If you want to specify greymap fonts then the low-order 16 bits will be the
    pixel size and the high order 16 bits will specify the bits/pixel. Thus 0x8000c
    would be a 12 pixel font with 8 bits per pixel, while either 0xc or 0x1000c
    could be used to refer to a 12 pixel bitmap font.
  <DT>
    <A HREF="elementmenu.html#Regenerate">BitmapsRegen</A>(sizes)

    ApplySubstitution(script,lang,tag)
  <DD>
    All three arguments must be strings of no more that four characters (shorter
    strings will be padded with blanks to become 4 character strings). For each
    selected glyph this command will look up that glyph's list of substitutions,
    and if it finds a substitution with the tag "tag" (and if that substitution
    matches the script and language combination) then it will apply the
    substitution-- that is it will find the variant glyph specified in the
    substitution and replace the current glyph with the variant, and clear the
    variant.
    <P>
    FontForge recognizes the string "*" as a wildcard for both the script and
    the language (not for the tag though). So if you wish to replace all glyphs

    is allowed to stray from the true path.<BR>
    The tan_bounds argument specifies the tangent of the angle between the curves
    at which smoothing will stop (argument is multiplied by .01 before use).<BR>
    And bump_size gives the maximum distance a bump can move from the line and
    still be smoothed out.<BR>
    If a fifth argument is given then it will be treated as the denominator of
    the error term (so users can express fraction pixel distances).<BR>
    Generally it is a bad idea to merge a line segment with any other than a
    colinear line segment. The longer the line segment, the more likely that
    such a merge will produce unpleasing results. The sixth argument, if present,
    specifies the maximum length for lines which may be merged (anything longer
    will not be merged).

    Allows you to add an Advanced Typography feature to a single selected glyph.
    The first argument may be either: Position, Pair, Substitution, AltSubs,
    MultSubs or Ligature. The second argument should be a script-lang list where
    each 4-character script name is followed by a comma separated list of 4 character

    how this feature modifies the metrics of this glyph. For Pair type the next
    argument is the name of the other glyph in the pair followed by 8 integral
    arguments, the first 4 specify the changes in positioning to the first glyph,
    the next four the changes for the second char. For substitution tags the
    fifth argument is the name of another glyph which will replace the current
    one. For an AltSubs tag the argument is a space separated list of glyph names
    any of which will replace the current one. For a MultSubs the argument is

    third should be a script-lang string like:<BR>
    <CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; grek{dflt} latn{dflt,VIT ,ROM }</CODE><BR>
    The fourth arg should be a 4 character opentype feature tag. The fifth argument
    should be the <A HREF="scripting.html#otf-flags">otf flags </A>(or -1 to
    make FontForge guess appropriate flags). The sixth and last argument should
    be the name of another AnchorClass to be merged into the same lookup (or
    a null string if this class merges with no other class yet).

    hint, etc. vstem hints follow hstems.
  <DT>
    ReplaceCharCounterMasks(array)
  <DD>
    This requires that there be exactly one glyph selected. It will create a
    set of counter masks for that glyph. The single argument must be an array
    of twelve element arrays of integers (in c this would be "int array[][12]").
    This is the format of a type2 counter mask. The number of elements in the
    top level array is the number of counter groups to be specified. The nested
    array thus corresponds to a counter mask, and is treated as an array of bytes.
    Each bit in the byte specifies whether the corresponding hint is active in
    this counter. (there are at most 96 hints, so at most 12 bytes).
    Array[i][0]&amp;0x80 corresponds to the first horizontal stem hint,
    Array[i][0]&amp;0x40 corresponds to the second, Array[i][1]&amp;0x80 corresponds
    to the eighth hint, etc.

    should be in em-units, otherwise units will be in pixels of the given bitmap
    strike. The size should be the pixelsize of the font. If you use anti-aliased
    fonts then size should be set to (depth&lt;&lt;16)|pixel_size. A value of

    MMAxisBounds(axis)
  <DD>
    Axis is an integer less than the number of axes in the mm font. Returns an

    MMChangeInstance(instance)
  <DD>
    Where instance is either a font name or a small integer. If passed a string
    FontForge searches through all fonts in the multi master font set (instance
    fonts and the weighted font) and changes the current font to the indicated
    one. If passed a small integer, then -1 indicates the weighted font and values

    Arg is as above. This returns true if the glyph contains any splines, references
    or images.

    CharInfo(str,script,lang,tag)
  <DD>
    There must be exactly one glyph selected in the font, and this returns
    information on it. The information returned depends on str with the obvious
    meanings:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	"Name" returns the glyph's name
      <LI>
	"Unicode" returns the glyph's unicode encoding
      <LI>
	"Encoding" returns the glyph's encoding in the current font
      <LI>
	"Width" returns the glyph's width
      <LI>
	"VWidth" returns the glyph's Vertical width
      <LI>
	"TeXHeight" returns the tex_height field (a value of 0x7fff indicates that
	a default value will be used)
      <LI>
	"TeXDepth" returns the tex_depth field (a value of 0x7fff indicates that
	a default value will be used)
      <LI>
	"TeXSubPos" returns the tex_sub_pos field (a value of 0x7fff indicates that
	a default value will be used)
      <LI>
	"TeXSuperPos" returns the tex_super_pos field (a value of 0x7fff indicates
	that a default value will be used)
      <LI>
	"LBearing" returns the glyph's left side bearing
      <LI>
	"RBearing" returns the glyph's right side bearing
      <LI>
	"BBox" returns a 4 element array containing [minimum-x-value, minimum-y-value,
	maximum-x-value, maximum-y-value] of the glyph.
      <LI>
	"Kern" (there must be a second argument here which specifies another glyph
	as in Select()) Returns the kern offset between the two glyphs (or 0 if none).
      <LI>
	"VKern" (there must be a second argument here which specifies another glyph
	as in Select()) Returns the vertical kern offset between the two glyphs (or
	0 if none).
      <LI>
	"Xextrema" (there must be a second argument here which specifies the vertical
	position) Returns a two element array containing the minimum and maximum
	horizontal positions on the contours of the glyph at the given vertical position.
	If the position is beyond the glyph's bounding box the minimum value will
	be set to 1 and the max to 0 (ie. max&lt;min which is impossible).
      <LI>
	"Yextrema" (there must be a second argument here which specifies the horizontal
	position) Returns a two element array containing the minimum and maximum
	vertical positions on the contours of the glyph at the given horizontal position.
	If the position is beyond the glyph's bounding box the minimum value will
	be set to 1 and the max to 0 (ie. max&lt;min which is impossible).
      <LI>
	"Color" returns the glyph's color as a 24bit rgb value (or -2 if no color
	has been assigned to the glyph).
      <LI>
	"Comment" returns the glyph's comment (it will be converted from unicode
	into the default encoding).
      <LI>
	"Changed" returns whether the glyph has been changed since the last save
	or load.
      <LI>
	"DontAutoHint" returns the status of the "Don't AutoHint" flag.
      <LI>
	"Position" takes three additional arguments, a script, a language and a tag
	(all 4 character strings) and returns whether the glyph has a Position alternate
	with that tag.
      <LI>
	"Pair" takes three additional arguments, a script, a language and a tag (all
	4 character strings) and returns whether the glyph has a Pairwise positioning
	alternate with that tag.
      <LI>
	"Substitution" takes three additional arguments, a script, a language and
	a tag (all 4 character strings) and returns the name of the Simple Substitution
	alternate with that tag (or a null string if there is none).
      <LI>
	"AltSubs" takes three additional arguments, a script, a language and a tag
	(all 4 character strings) and returns a space separated list of the names
	of all alternate substitutions with that tag (or a null string if there is
	none).
      <LI>
	"MultSubs" takes three additional arguments, a script, a language and a tag
	(all 4 character strings) and returns a space separated list of all the names
	of all glyphs this glyph gets decomposed into with that tag (or a null string
	if there is none).
      <LI>
	"Ligature" takes three additional arguments, a script, a language and a tag
	(all 4 character strings) and returns a space separated list of the names
	of all components with that tag (or a null string if there is none).
      <LI>
	"GlyphIndex" returns the index of the current glyph in the ttf 'glyf' table,
	or -1 if it has been created since. This value may change when a
	truetype/opentype font is generated (to the index in the generated font).

  <DT>
    SetGlyphTeX(height,depth[,subpos,suppos])
  <DD>
    Sets the tex_height and tex_depth fields of this glyph. And the subscript
    pos and superscript pos for math fonts.
  <DT>
    GetPosSub(feature-tag,script,lang)
  <DD>
    One glyph must be selected, this returns information about GPOS/GSUB features
    attached to this glyph (It will not return information about class based
    kerning or contextual features -- nothing that applies to the font as a whole
    -- just things relating to the current glyph). The arguments must be 4 letter
    strings (or the special string "*" which acts as a wildcard). It returns
    an Array of Arrays (with one entry for each feature which matches the arguments).
    If nothing matches a 0 length array will be returned.
    <P>
    Each sub-array contains the following information
    <UL>
      <LI>
	The feature tag (a string)
      <LI>
	The script/language string of this feature
      <LI>
	The type (As a string, One of <CODE>Position, Pair, Substitution, AltSubs,
	MultSubs </CODE>or<CODE> Ligature</CODE>)
    </UL>
    <P>
    The remaining entries depend on the type.
    <DL>
      <DT>
	For Positions
      <DD>
	There will be 4 numbers indicating respectively the contents of a GPOS value
	record (dx,dy,d_horizontal_advance,d_vertical_advance)
      <DT>
	For Pairs
      <DD>
	A string containing the name of the other glyph in the pair
	<P>
	A list of 8 numbers indicating the contents of two GPOS value records (the
	first four numbers control the current glyph, the next four numbers control
	the second glyph)
      <DT>
	For Substitutions
      <DD>
	A string containing the name of a glyph with which the current glyph is to
	be replaced.
      <DT>
	For the others
      <DD>
	A set of glyph names, one for each component.

  The <A NAME="Execute">Execute</A> Script dialog
</H2>
<P>
This dialog allows you to type a script directly in to FontForge and then
run it. Of course the most common case is that you'll have a script file
somewhere that you want to execute, so there's a button [Call] down at the
bottom of the dlg. Pressing [Call] will bring up a file picker dlg looking
for files with the extension *.pe (you can change that by typing a wildcard
sequence and pressing the [Filter] button). After you have selected your
script the appropriate text to text to invoke it will be placed in the text
area.
<P>
The current font of the script will be set to whatever font you invoked it
from.
<H2>
  The Scripts <A NAME="menu">Menu</A>
</H2>
<P>
You can use the preference dialog to create a list of frequently used scripts.
Invoke <A HREF="prefs.html#scripts">File-&gt;Preferences</A> and select the
Scripts tag. In this dialog are ten possible entries, each one should have
a name (to be displayed in the menu) and an associated script file to be
run.
<P>
After you have set up your preferences you can invoke scripts from the font
view, either directly from the menu (File-&gt;Scripts-&gt;&lt;your name&gt;)
or by a hot key. The first script you added will be invoked by Cnt-Alt-1,
then second by Cnt-Alt-2, and the tenth by Cnt-Alt-0.
<P>
The current font of the script will be set to whatever font you invoked it
from.
