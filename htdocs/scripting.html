  Writing scripts to change fonts in PfaEdit
</H1>
<P>
PfaEdit includes an interpreter so you can write scripts to modify fonts.
<P>
At the moment pfaedit will either run a script (and not put up any windows),
or it will display windows and not run any scripts.
<P>
The scripting language provides access to much of the functionality found
in the font view's menus. It does not currently (and probably never will)
provide access to everything. (If you find a lack let me know, I may put
it in for you). It does not provide commands for building up a character
out of splines, instead it allows you to do high level modifications to
characters.
<P>
In general I envision this as being useful for things like taking a latin
font and extending it to contain cyrillic characters. So the script might:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Reencode the font
  <LI>
    Place a reference to Latin "A" at Cyrillic "A"
  <LI>
    Copy Latin "R" to Cyrillic "YA"
  <LI>
    Flip "YA" horizontally
  <LI>
    Correct its direction
  <LI>
    ... and so forth
</UL>
<P>
The syntax is rather like a mixture of C and shell commands. Every file
corresponds to a procedure. As in a shell script arguments passed to the
file are identified as $1, $2, ... $n. $0 is the file name itself. $argc
gives the number of arguments. $argv[&lt;expr&gt;] provides array access
to the arguments.
<P>
Terms can be
<UL>
  <LI>
    A variable name (like "$1" or "i")
  <LI>
    an integer expressed in decimal, hex or octal
  <LI>
    a unicode code point (which has a prefix of "0u" or "0U" and is followed
    by a string of hex digits. This is only used by the select command.
  <LI>
    A string which may be enclosed in either double or single quotes
  <LI>
    a procedure to call or file to invoke.
  <LI>
    an expression within parentheses
</UL>
<P>
There are three different comments supported:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Starting with a "#" character and proceding to end of line
  <LI>
    Starting with "//" and proceding to end of line
  <LI>
    Starting with "/*" and proceding to "*/"
</UL>
<P>
Expressions are similar to those in C, a few operators have been omitted,
a few added from shell scripts. Operator precedence has been simplified slightly.
So operators (and their precedences) are:
<UL>
  <LI>
    unary operators (+, -, !, ~, ++ (prefix and postfix), --(prefix and postfix),
    () (procedure call), :h, :t, :r, :e<BR>
    Most of these are as expected in C, the last four are borrowed from shell
    scripts and are applied to strings
    <UL>
      <LI>
	:h gives the head (directory) of a pathspec
      <LI>
	:t gives the tail (filename) of a pathspec
      <LI>
	:r gives the pathspec without the extension (if any)
      <LI>
	:e gives the extension
    </UL>
  <LI>
    *, /, % (binary multiplicative operators)
  <LI>
    +, - (binary arithmetric operators)<BR>
    If the first operand of + is a string then + will be treated as concatenation
    rather than addition. If the second operand is a number it will be converted
    to a string (decimal representation) and then concatenated.
  <LI>
    ==, !=, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;= (comparison operators, may be applied to
    either two integers or two strings)
  <LI>
    &amp;&amp;, &amp; (logical and, bitwise and. (logical and will do short circuit
    evaluation))
  <LI>
    ||, |, ^ (logical or, bitwise or, bitwise exclusive or (logical or will do
    short circuit evaluation))
  <LI>
    =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %= (assignment operators as in C. The += will act as
    concatenation if the first operand is a string.)
</UL>
<P>
Note there is no comma operator, and no "?:" operator. The precedence of
"and" and "or" has been simplified, as has that of the assignment operators.
<P>
Procedure calls may be applied either to a name token, or to a string. If
the name or string is recognized as one of PfaEdit's internal procedures
it will be executed, otherwise it will be assumed to be a filename containing
another pfaedit script file, this file will be invoked (since filenames can
contain characters not legal in name tokens it is important to allow general
strings to specify filenames). If the procedure name does not contain a directory
then it is assumed to be in the same directory as the current script file.
<P>
Variables may be created by assigning a value to them (only with the "="),
so:<BR>
<CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; i=3</CODE><BR>
could be used to define "i" as a variable. Variables are limited in scope
to the current file, they will not be inherited by called procedures.
<P>
A statement may be
<UL>
  <LI>
    an expression
  <LI>
    <CODE>if ( expression )<BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; statements<BR>
    {elseif ( expression )<BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; statements}<BR>
    [else<BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; statements]<BR>
    endif</CODE>
  <LI>
    <CODE>while ( expression )<BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; statements<BR>
    endloop</CODE>
  <LI>
    <CODE>return [ expression ]</CODE>
  <LI>
    <CODE>shift</CODE>
</UL>
<P>
As with C, non-zero expressions are defined to be true.<BR>
A return statement may be followed by a return value (the expression) or
a procedure may return nothing (void).<BR>
The shift statement is stolen from shell scripts and shifts all arguments
down by one. (argument 0, the name of the script file, remains unchanged.<BR>
Statements are terminated either by a new line or a semicolon.
<P>
Trivial example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>i=0;	#semicolon is not needed here, but it's ok
while ( i&lt;3 )
   if ( i==1 /* pointless comment */ )
	Print( "Got to one" )	// Another comment
   endif
   ++i
endloop
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
PfaEdit maintains the concept of a "current font" almost all commands refer
only to the current font (and require that there be a font). The Open(),
New() and Close() commands all change the current font. PfaEdit also maintains
a list of all fonts that are currently open. This list is in no particular
order.
<P>
All builtin variables begin with "$", you may not create any variables that
start with "$" yourself (though you may assign to (some) already existing
ones)
<UL>
  <LI>
    <CODE>$0 </CODE>the current script filename
  <LI>
    <CODE>$1 </CODE>the first argument to the script file
  <LI>
    <CODE>$2 </CODE>the second argument to the script file
  <LI>
    ...
  <LI>
    <CODE>$argc</CODE> the number of arguments passed to the script file (this
    will always be at least 1 as $0 is always present)
  <LI>
    <CODE>$argv[&lt;expr&gt;] </CODE>allows you to access the n'th argument
  <LI>
    <CODE>$curfont </CODE>the name of the filename in which the current font
    resides
  <LI>
    <CODE>$firstfont </CODE>the name of the filename of the font which is first
    on the font list
  <LI>
    <CODE>$nextfont </CODE>the name of the filename of the font which follows
    the current font on the list (or the empty string if the current font is
    the last one on the list)
  <LI>
    <CODE>$trace</CODE> if this is set to one then PfaEdit will trace each procedure
    call.
</UL>
<P>
The built in procedures are very similar to the menu items with the same
names.
<DL>
  <DT>
    Print(arg1,arg2,arg3,...)
  <DD>
    This corresponds to no menu item. It will print all of its arguments to stdout.
    It can execute with no current font. 
      <HR>
  <DT>
    Open(filename)
  <DD>
    This makes the font named by filename be the current font. If filename has
    not yet been loaded into memory it will be loaded now. It can execute with
    no current font.
  <DT>
    New()
  <DD>
    This creates a new font. It can execute with no current font.
  <DT>
    Close()
  <DD>
    This frees up any memory taken up by the current font and drops it off the
    list of loaded fonts. After this executes there will be no current font.
  <DT>
    Save([filename])
  <DD>
    If no filename is specified then this saves the current font back into its
    sfd file (if the font has no sfd file then this is an error). With one argument
    it executes a SaveAs command, saving the current font to that filename.
  <DT>
    Generate(filename[,bitmaptype])
  <DD>
    Generates a font. The type of font is determined by the extension of the
    filename. If present, bitmaptype may be one of:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	bdf
      <LI>
	ms (for EBDT table in truetype)
      <LI>
	apple (for bdat table in truetype)
      <LI>
	gdf
      <LI>
	bin (for nfnt in macbinary)
      <LI>
	dfont (for nfnt in dfont)
      <LI>
	"" for no bitmaps
    </UL>
  <DT>
    Quit(status)
  <DD>
    Causes PfaEdit to exit with the given status. It can execute with no current
    font. 
      <HR>
  <DT>
    Cut
  <DD>
    Makes a copy of all selected characters and saves it in the clipboard, then
    clears out the selected characters
  <DT>
    Copy
  <DD>
    Makes a copy of all selected characters.
  <DT>
    Copy Reference
  <DD>
    Makes references to all selected characters and stores them in the clipboard.
  <DT>
    Copy Width
  <DD>
    Stores the widths of all selected characters in the clipboard
  <DT>
    Paste
  <DD>
    Copies the clipboard into the current font (removing what was there before)
  <DT>
    PasteInto
  <DD>
    Copies the clipboard into the current font (merging with what was there before)
  <DT>
    Clear
  <DD>
    Clears out all selected characters
  <DT>
    ClearBackground
  <DD>
    Clears the background of all selected characters
  <DT>
    CopyFgToBd
  <DD>
    Copies all foreground splines into the background in all selected characters
  <DT>
    UnlinkReference
  <DD>
    Unlinks all references within all selected characters
  <DT>
    SelectAll
  <DD>
    Selects all characters
  <DT>
    SelectNone
  <DD>
    Deselects all characters
  <DT>
    Select(arg1, arg2, ...)
  <DD>
    This clears out the current selection, then for each pair of arguments it
    selects all characters between (inclusive) the bounds specified by the pair.
    If there is a final singleton argument then that single character will be
    selected. An argument may be specified by:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	an integer which specifies the location in the current font's encoding
      <LI>
	a postscript unicode name which gets mapped into the current font's encoding
      <LI>
	a unicode code point (0u61) which gets mapped to the current font's encoding
    </UL>
  <DT>
    SelectMore(arg1, arg2, ...)
  <DD>
    The same as the previous command except that it does not clear the selection,
    so it extends the current selection. 
      <HR>
  <DT>
    Reencode(encoding-name)
  <DD>
    Reencodes the current font into the given encoding which may be:<BR>
    iso8859-1, isolatin1, latin1, iso8859-2, latin2, iso8859-3, latin3, iso8859-4,
    latin4, iso8859-5, iso8859-6, iso8859-7, iso8859-8, iso8859-9, iso8859-10,

    win, mac, wansung, big5, johab, jis208, unicode, iso10646-1 (or one of the
    user defined encodings).
  <DT>
    Transform(t1,t2,t3,t4,t5,t6)
  <DD>
    Each argument will be divided by 100. and then all selected characters will
    be transformed by this matrix
  <DT>
    HFlip([about-x])
  <DD>
    All selected characters will be horizontally flipped about the vertical line
    through x=about-x. If no argument is given then all selected characters will
    be flipped about their central point.
  <DT>
    VFlip([about-y])
  <DD>
    All selected characters will be vertically flipped about the horizontal line
    through y=about-y. If no argument is given then all selected characters will
    be flipped about their central point.
  <DT>
    Rotate(angle[,ox,oy])
  <DD>
    Rotates all selected character the specified number of degrees. If the last
    two args are specified they provide the origin of the rotation, otherwise
    the center of the character is used.
  <DT>
    Scale(factor[,yfactor][,ox,oy])
  <DD>
    All selected characters will be scaled (scale factors are in percent)
    <UL>
      <LI>
	with one argument they will be scaled uniformly about the character's center
	point
      <LI>
	with two arguments the first specifies the scale factor for x, the second
	for y. Again scaling will be about the center point
      <LI>
	with three arguments they will be scaled uniformly about the specified center
      <LI>
	with four arguments they will be scaled differently about the specified center
    </UL>
  <DT>
    Skew(angle[,ox,oy])
  <DD>
    All selected characters will be skewed by the given angle.
  <DT>
    Move(delta-x,delta-y)
  <DD>
    All selected characters will have their points moved the given amount.
  <DT>
    ExpandStroke(width)<BR>
    ExpandStroke(width,caligraphic-angle)<BR>
    ExpandStroke(width,line cap, line join)

  <DT>
    InFont(arg)
  <DD>
    Returns whether the argument is in the font. The argument may be an integer
    in which case true is returned if the value is &gt;= 0 and &lt; total number
    of characters in the font. Otherwise if the argument is a unicode code point
    or a postscript character name, true is returned if that character is in
    the font.
