  Writing scripts to change fonts in PfaEdit
</H1>
<P>
PfaEdit includes an interpreter so you can write scripts to modify fonts.

<P>
If you start pfaedit with a script on the command line it will not put up
any windows and it will exit when the script is done.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>$ pfaedit -script scriptfile.pe {fontnames}
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
PfaEdit can also be used as an interpreter that the shell will automatically
pass scripts to. If you a mark your script files as executable<BR>
<CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; $ chmod +x scriptfile.pe</CODE><BR>
and begin each one with the line<BR>
<CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; #!/usr/local/bin/pfaedit</CODE><BR>
(or wherever pfaedit happens to reside on your system) then you can invoke
the script just by typing<BR>
<CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; $ scriptfile.pe {fontnames}</CODE>
<P>
If you wish PfaEdit to read a script from stdin then you can use "-" as a
"filename" for stdin. (If you build PfaEdit without X11 then pfaedit will
attempt to read a script file from <CODE>stdin</CODE> if none is given on
the command line.)
<P>
You can also start a script from within PfaEdit with <CODE>File-&gt;Execute
Script</CODE>, and you can use the Preference Dlg to define a set of frequently
used scripts which can be invoked directly by menu.
<P>
The scripting language provides access to much of the functionality found
in the font view's menus. It does not currently (and probably never will)
provide access to everything. (If you find a lack let me know, I may put
it in for you). It does not provide commands for building up a character
out of splines, instead it allows you to do high level modifications to
characters.
<P>
If you set the environment variable <CODE>PFAEDIT_VERBOSE</CODE> (it doesn't
need a value, just needs to be set) then PfaEdit will print scripts to stdout
as it executes them.
<P>
In general I envision this as being useful for things like taking a latin
font and extending it to contain cyrillic characters. So the script might:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Reencode the font
  <LI>
    Place a reference to Latin "A" at Cyrillic "A"
  <LI>
    Copy Latin "R" to Cyrillic "YA"
  <LI>
    Flip "YA" horizontally
  <LI>
    Correct its direction
  <LI>
    ... and so forth
</UL>
<H2>
  Scripting <A NAME="Language">Language</A>
</H2>
<P>
The syntax is rather like a mixture of C and shell commands. Every file
corresponds to a procedure. As in a shell script arguments passed to the
file are identified as $1, $2, ... $n. $0 is the file name itself. $argc
gives the number of arguments. $argv[&lt;expr&gt;] provides array access
to the arguments.
<P>
Terms can be
<UL>
  <LI>
    A variable name (like "$1" or "i" or "@fontvar" or "_global")<BR>
    The scope of the variable depends on the initial character of its name.
    <UL>
      <LI>
	A '$' signifies that it is a built-in variable. The user cannot create any
	new variables beginning with '$'. Some, but not all, of these may be assigned
	to.
      <LI>
	A '_' signifies that the variable is global, it is always available. You
	can use these to store context across different script files (or to access
	data within nested script files).
      <LI>
	A '@' signifies that the variable is associated with the font. Any two scripts
	looking at the same font will have access to the same variables.
      <LI>
	A variable which begins with a letter is a local variable. It is only meaningful
	within the current script file. Nested script files may have different variables
	with the same names.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    an integer expressed in decimal, hex or octal
  <LI>
    a unicode code point (which has a prefix of "0u" or "0U" and is followed
    by a string of hex digits. This is only used by the select command.
  <LI>
    A string which may be enclosed in either double or single quotes
  <LI>
    a procedure to call or file to invoke.
  <LI>
    an expression within parentheses
</UL>
<P>
There are three different comments supported:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Starting with a "#" character and proceding to end of line
  <LI>
    Starting with "//" and proceding to end of line
  <LI>
    Starting with "/*" and proceding to "*/"
</UL>
<P>
Expressions are similar to those in C, a few operators have been omitted,
a few added from shell scripts. Operator precedence has been simplified slightly.
So operators (and their precedences) are:
<UL>
  <LI>
    unary operators (+, -, !, ~, ++ (prefix and postfix), --(prefix and postfix),
    () (procedure call), [] (array index), :h, :t, :r, :e<BR>
    Most of these are as expected in C, the last four are borrowed from shell
    scripts and are applied to strings
    <UL>
      <LI>
	:h gives the head (directory) of a pathspec
      <LI>
	:t gives the tail (filename) of a pathspec
      <LI>
	:r gives the pathspec without the extension (if any)
      <LI>
	:e gives the extension
    </UL>
  <LI>
    *, /, % (binary multiplicative operators)
  <LI>
    +, - (binary arithmetric operators)<BR>
    If the first operand of + is a string then + will be treated as concatenation
    rather than addition. If the second operand is a number it will be converted
    to a string (decimal representation) and then concatenated.
  <LI>
    ==, !=, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;= (comparison operators, may be applied to
    either two integers or two strings)
  <LI>
    &amp;&amp;, &amp; (logical and, bitwise and. (logical and will do short circuit
    evaluation))
  <LI>
    ||, |, ^ (logical or, bitwise or, bitwise exclusive or (logical or will do
    short circuit evaluation))
  <LI>
    =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %= (assignment operators as in C. The += will act as
    concatenation if the first operand is a string.)
</UL>
<P>
Note there is no comma operator, and no "?:" operator. The precedence of
"and" and "or" has been simplified, as has that of the assignment operators.
<P>
Procedure calls may be applied either to a name token, or to a string. If
the name or string is recognized as one of PfaEdit's internal procedures
it will be executed, otherwise it will be assumed to be a filename containing
another pfaedit script file, this file will be invoked (since filenames can
contain characters not legal in name tokens it is important to allow general
strings to specify filenames). If the procedure name does not contain a directory
then it is assumed to be in the same directory as the current script file.
<P>
Arrays are passed by reference, strings and integers are passed by value.
<P>
Variables may be created by assigning a value to them (only with the "="),
so:<BR>
<CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; i=3</CODE><BR>
could be used to define "i" as a variable. Variables are limited in scope
to the current file, they will not be inherited by called procedures.
<P>
A statement may be
<UL>
  <LI>
    an expression
  <LI>
    <CODE>if ( expression )<BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; statements<BR>
    {elseif ( expression )<BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; statements}<BR>
    [else<BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; statements]<BR>
    endif</CODE>
  <LI>
    <CODE>while ( expression )<BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; statements<BR>
    endloop</CODE>
  <LI>
    <CODE>foreach<BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; statements<BR>
    endloop</CODE>
  <LI>
    <CODE>return [ expression ]</CODE>
  <LI>
    <CODE>shift</CODE>
</UL>
<P>
As with C, non-zero expressions are defined to be true.<BR>
A return statement may be followed by a return value (the expression) or
a procedure may return nothing (void).<BR>
The shift statement is stolen from shell scripts and shifts all arguments
down by one. (argument 0, the name of the script file, remains unchanged.<BR>
The foreach statement requires that there be a current font. It executes
the statements once for each character in the selection. Within the statements
only one character at a time will be selected. After execution the selection
will be restored to what it was initially. (Caveat: Don't reencode the font
within a foreach statement).<BR>
Statements are terminated either by a new line or a semicolon.
<P>
Trivial example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>i=0;	#semicolon is not needed here, but it's ok
while ( i&lt;3 )
   if ( i==1 /* pointless comment */ )
	Print( "Got to one" )	// Another comment
   endif
   ++i
endloop
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
PfaEdit maintains the concept of a "current font" almost all commands refer
only to the current font (and require that there be a font). If you start
a script with File-&gt;Execute Script, the font you were editing will be
current, otherwise there will be no initial current font. The Open(), New()
and Close() commands all change the current font. PfaEdit also maintains
a list of all fonts that are currently open. This list is in no particular
order. The list starts with $firstfont.
<P>
Similarly when working with cid keyed fonts, PfaEdit works in the "current
sub font", and most commands refer to this font. The CIDChangeSubFont() command
can alter that.
<P>
All builtin <A NAME="variables">variables</A> begin with "$", you may not
create any variables that start with "$" yourself (though you may assign
to (some) already existing ones)

    returns an empty string. This can be used to determine if any font at all
    is loaded into pfaedit.
  <LI>
    <CODE>$nextfont </CODE>the name of the filename of the font which follows
    the current font on the list (or the empty string if the current font is

    font (or the empty string if the current sub-font is the last)
  <LI>
    <CODE>$bitmaps </CODE>returns an array containing all bitmap pixelsizes generated
    for this font. (If the font database contains greymaps then they will be
    indicated in the array as
    <CODE>(&lt;BitmapDepth&gt;&lt;&lt;16)|&lt;PixelSize&gt;</CODE>)
  <LI>
    <CODE>$selection</CODE> returns an array containing one entry for each character

    call.
  <LI>
    <CODE>$version</CODE> returns a string containing the current version of
    pfaedit. This should look something like "020817".
  <LI>
    <CODE>$</CODE>&lt;<A NAME="Preference">Preference</A> Item&gt; (for example
    <CODE>$AutoHint</CODE>) allows you to examine the value of that preference
    item (to set it use <CODE><A HREF="#SetPref">SetPref</A></CODE>)
</UL>
<P>
The following example will perform an action on all loaded fonts:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>file = $firstfont
while ( file != "" )
   Open(file)
   /* Do Stuff */
   file = $nextfont
endloop
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The built in <A NAME="procedures">procedures</A> are very similar to the
menu items with the same names.
<DL>
  <DT>
    Print(arg1,arg2,arg3,...)
  <DD>
    This corresponds to no menu item. It will print all of its arguments to stdout.
    It can execute with no current font.
  <DT>
    PostNotice(str)
  <DD>
    When run from the UI will put up a window displaying the string (the window
    will not block the program and will disappear after a minute or so). When
    run from the command line will write the string to stderr.
  <DT>
    Error(str)
  <DD>
    Prints out str as an error message and aborts the current script
  <DT>
    AskUser(question[,default-answer])
  <DD>
    Asks the user the question and returns an answer (a string). A default-answer
    may be specified too.
  <DT>
    Array(size)
  <DD>
    Allocates an array of the indicated size.
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <PRE>a = Array(10)
i = 0;
while ( i&lt;10 )
   a[i] = i++
endloop
a[3] = "string"
a[4] = Array(10)
a[4][0] = "Nested array";
</PRE>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <DT>
    SizeOf(arr)
  <DD>
    Returns the number of elements in an array.
  <DT>
    Strsub(str,start[,end])
  <DD>
    Returns a substring of the string argument. The substring beings at position
    indexed by start and ends at the position indexed by end (if end is omitted
    the end of the string will be used, the first position is position 0). Thus
    <CODE>Strsub("abcdef",2,3) == "c" </CODE>and <CODE>Strsub("abcdef",2) ==
    "cdef"</CODE>
  <DT>
    Strlen(str)
  <DD>
    Returns the length of the string.
  <DT>
    Strstr(haystack,needle)
  <DD>
    Returns the index of the first occurance of the string needle within the
    string haystack (or -1 if not found).
  <DT>
    Strrstr(haystack,needle)
  <DD>
    Returns the index of the last occurance of the string needle within the string
    haystack (or -1 if not found).
  <DT>
    Strcasestr(haystack,needle)
  <DD>
    Returns the index of the first occurance of the string needle within the
    string haystack ignoring case in the search (or -1 if not found).
  <DT>
    Strcasecmp(str1,str2)
  <DD>
    Compares the two strings ignoring case, returns zero if the two are equal,
    a negative number if str1&lt;str2 and a positive number if str1&gt;str2
  <DT>
    Strtol(str[,base])
  <DD>
    Parses as much of str as possible and returns the integer value it represents.
    A second argument may be used to specify the base of the conversion (it defaults
    to 10). Behavior is as for strtol(3).
  <DT>
    Strskipint(str[,base])
  <DD>
    Parses as much of str as possible and returns the offset to the first character
    that could not be parsed.
  <DT>
    GetPref(str)
  <DD>
    Gets the value of the preference item whose name is contained in str. Only
    boolean, integer, real, string and file preference items may be returned.
    Boolean and real items are returned with integer type and file items are
    returned with string type.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="SetPrefs">SetPrefs</A>(str,val[,val2])
  <DD>
    Sets the value of the preference item whose name is containted in str. If
    the preference item has a real type then a second argument may be passed
    and the value set will be val/val2.
  <DT>
    UnicodeFromName(name)
  <DD>
    Looks the string "name" up in PfaEdit's database of commonly used glyph names
    and returns the unicode value associated with that name, or -1 if not found.
    This does <EM>not</EM> check the current font (if any).
  <DT>
    Chr(int)<BR>
    Chr(array)
  <DD>
    Takes an integer [0,255] and returns a single character string containing
    that code point. Internally PfaEdit interprets strings as if they were in
    ISO8859-1 (well really, PfaEdit just uses ASCII-US internally). If passed
    an array, it should be an array of integers and the result is the string.
  <DT>
    Ord(string[,pos])
  <DD>
    Returns an array of integers represenging the encoding of the characters
    in the string. If pos is given it should be an integer less than the string
    length and the function will return the integer encoding of that character
    in the string.
  <DT>
    Utf8(int)
  <DD>
    Takes an integer [0,0x10ffff] and returns the utf8 string representing that
    unicode code point. If passed an array of integers it will generate a utf8
    string containing all of those unicode code points. (it does not expect to
    get surrogates).
  <DT>
      <HR>
  <DT>
    FontsInFile(filename)
  <DD>
    Returns an array of strings containing the names of all fonts within a file.
    Most files contain one font, but some (mac font suitcases, dfonts, ttc files,
    svg files, etc) may contain several. If the file contains no fonts (or the
    file doesn't exist, or the fonts aren't named), a zero length array is returned.
    It does not open the font. It can execute without a current font.
  <DT>
    Open(filename[,flags])
  <DD>
    This makes the font named by filename be the current font. If filename has
    not yet been loaded into memory it will be loaded now. It can execute without
    a current font.<BR>
    When loading from a ttc file (mac suitcase, dfont, svg, etc), a particular
    font may be selected by placing the fontname in parens and appending it to
    the filename, as <CODE>Open("gulim.ttc(Dotum)")</CODE><BR>
    The optional flags argument current has only one flag in it:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	1 =&gt; the user does have the appropriate license to examine the font no
	matter what the fstype setting is.
    </UL>
  <DT>
    New()
  <DD>
    This creates a new font. It can execute with no current font.
  <DT>
    Close()
  <DD>
    This frees up any memory taken up by the current font and drops it off the
    list of loaded fonts. After this executes there will be no current font.
  <DT>
    Save([filename])
  <DD>
    If no filename is specified then this saves the current font back into its
    sfd file (if the font has no sfd file then this is an error). With one argument
    it executes a SaveAs command, saving the current font to that filename.
  <DT>
    Generate(filename[,bitmaptype[,fmflags[,res[,mult-sfd-file]]]])
  <DD>
    Generates a font. The type of font is determined by the extension of the
    filename. Valid extensions are:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	pfa
      <LI>
	pfb
      <LI>
	bin (a mac postscript (pfb) resource in a mac binary wrapper)<BR>
	res (on the Mac itself PfaEdit will put the result directly into a font suitcase
	file, and the extension should be ".res" rather than ".bin")
	<P>
	Note: you must also create a bitmap font in NFNT format or the mac will not
	recognize your postscript font.
      <LI>
	mult (splits a big font up into multiple pfb fonts each with 256 characters)
      <LI>
	ps (type 0)

      <LI>
	ttf.bin (a mac truetype resource in a mac binary wrapper)<BR>
	suit (on the Mac itself PfaEdit will put the result directly into a font

	dfont (a mac truetype resource in a dfont file)
      <LI>
	otf (either cid or not depending on the font)

	svg (an svg font)
      <LI>
	&lt;null extension&gt; If you don't want to generate an outline font at all
	(but do want to provide a filename for bitmap or metrics files) then provide
	a null extension (ie. <CODE>"Times."</CODE> but NOT <CODE>"Times"</CODE>).
    </UL>
    <P>
    If present, bitmaptype may be one of:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	bdf
      <LI>
	ttf (for EBDT/bdat table in truetype/opentype)
      <LI>
	sbit (for EBDT/bdat table in truetype without any outline font)
      <LI>
	bin (for nfnt in macbinary)
	<P>
	NOTE: Mac OS/X does not appear to support NFNT bitmaps. However even though
	unused itself, an NFNT bitmap must be present for a resource based postscript
	font to be used.
      <LI>
	fnt (For windows FNT format)
      <LI>
	otb (For X11 opentype bitmap format)
      <LI>
	"" for no bitmaps
    </UL>
    <P>
    If you do not wish to generate an outline font then give the filename the
    extension of ".bdf".<BR>
    fmflags controls whether an afm or pfm file should be generated
    <UL>

    Import(filename)
  <DD>
    Either imports a bitmap font into the database, or imports background image[s]
    into various characters. There may be one or two arguments. The first must
    be a string representing a filename. The extension of the file determines
    how the import procedes. If present the second argument must be an integer,
    if the first argument is a bitmap font then the second argument controls
    whether it is imported into the bitmap list (0) or to fill up the backgrounds
    of characters (1).
    <UL>
      <LI>
	If the extension is ".bdf" then a bdf font will be imported
      <LI>
	If the extension is ".pcf" then a pcf font will be imported.
      <LI>
	If the extension is ".ttf" then the EBDT or bdat table of the ttf file will
	be searched for bitmap fonts
      <LI>
	If the extension is "pk" then a metafont pk (bitmap font) file will be import
	and by default placed in the background
      <LI>
	Otherwise if the extension is an image extension, and any loaded images will
	be placed in the background.
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    If the filename contains a "*" then it should be a recognized template in

  <DT>
    SetItalicAngle(angle[,denom])
  <DD>
    Sets the postscript italic angle field appropriately. If denom is specified

    (a hack to get real values). The angle should be in degrees.
  <DT>
    SetTTFName(lang,nameid,utf8-string)
  <DD>
    Sets the indicated truetype name in the MS platform. Lang must be one of
    the
    <A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/opentype/name.jsp#lang3">language/locales</A>

    integers used to indicate a standard name</A>, while the final argument should
    be a utf8 encoded string which will become the value of that entry. A null
    string ("") may be used to clear an entry.<BR>
    Example: To set the SubFamily string in the American English

    <CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp;SetTTFName(0x409,2,"Bold Oblique")</CODE>
  <DT>
    GetTTFName(lang,nameid)

    as "".
  <DT>
    SetPanose(array)<BR>
    SetPanose(index,value)
  <DD>
    This sets the panose values for the font. Either it takes an array of 10

    <CODE>font.panose[index] = value</CODE>
  <DT>
    SetUniqueID(value)
  <DD>
    Sets the postscript uniqueid field as requested. If you give a value of 0
    then PfaEdit will pick a reasonable random number for you.
  <DT>
    SetTeXParams(type,design-size,slant,space,stretch,shrink,xheight,quad,extraspace[...])
  <DD>
    Sets the TeX (text) font parameters for the font.<BR>
    Type may be 1, 2 or 3, depending on whether the font is text, math or math
    extension. <BR>
    DesignSize is the pointsize the font was designed for.<BR>
    The remaining parameters are described in Knuth's The MetaFont Book, pp.
    98-100.<BR>
    Slant is expressed as a percentage. All the others are expressed in
    em-units.<BR>
    If type is 1 then the 9 indicated arguments are required. If type is 2 then
    24 arguments are required (the remaining 15 are described in the metafont
    book). If type is 3 then 15 arguments are required.
  <DT>
    SetCharName(name[,set-from-name-flag])
  <DD>
    Sets the currently selected character to have the given name. If
    set-from-name-flag is absent or is present and true then it will also set
    the unicode value and the ligature string to match the name.
  <DT>
    SetUnicodeValue(uni[,set-from-value-flag])
  <DD>
    Sets the currently selected character to have the given unicode value. If
    set-from-value-flag is absent or is present and true then it will also set
    the name and the ligature string to match the value.
  <DT>
    SetCharColor(color)
  <DD>
    Sets any currently selected characters to have the given color (expressed
    as 24 bit rgb (0xff0000 is red) with the special value of -2 meaning the
    default color.
  <DT>
    SetCharComment(comment)
  <DD>
    Sets the currently selected character to have the given comment. The comment
    is converted via the current encoding to unicode.
  <DT>
    BitmapsAvail(sizes)
  <DD>
    Controls what bitmap sizes are stored in the font's database. It is passed
    an array of sizes. If a size is specified which is not in the font database
    it will be generated. If a size is not specified which is in the font database
    it will be removed. A size which is specifed and present in the font database
    will not be touched.<BR>
    If you want to specify greymap fonts then the low-order 16 bits will be the
    pixel size and the high order 16 bits will specify the bits/pixel. Thus 0x8000c
    would be a 12 pixel font with 8 bits per pixel, while either 0xc or 0x1000c
    could be used to refer to a 12 pixel bitmap font.
  <DT>
    BitmapsRegen(sizes)
  <DD>
    Allows you to update specific bitmaps in an already generated bitmap font.
    It will regenerate the bitmaps of all selected characters at the specified
    pixelsizes.
  <DT>
    ApplySubstitution(script,lang,tag)
  <DD>
    All three arguments must be strings of no more that four characters (shorter
    strings will be padded with blanks to become 4 character strings). For each
    selected character this command will look up that character's list of
    substitutions, and if it finds a substitution with the tag "tag" (and if
    that substitution matches the script and language combination) then it will
    apply the substitution-- that is it will find the variant character specified
    in the substitution and replace the current character with the variant, and
    remove the variant from the font.
    <P>
    PfaEdit recognizes the string "*" as a wildcard for both the script and the
    language (not for the tag though). So you wish to replace all glyphs with
    their vertical variants:

  <DT>
    HFlip([about-x])
  <DD>
    All selected characters will be horizontally flipped about the vertical line
    through x=about-x. If no argument is given then all selected characters will
    be flipped about their central point.
  <DT>
    VFlip([about-y])
  <DD>
    All selected characters will be vertically flipped about the horizontal line
    through y=about-y. If no argument is given then all selected characters will
    be flipped about their central point.
  <DT>
    Rotate(angle[,ox,oy])
  <DD>
    Rotates all selected character the specified number of degrees. If the last
    two args are specified they provide the origin of the rotation, otherwise
    the center of the character is used.
  <DT>
    Scale(factor[,yfactor][,ox,oy])
  <DD>
    All selected characters will be scaled (scale factors are in percent)
    <UL>
      <LI>
	with one argument they will be scaled uniformly about the character's center
	point
      <LI>
	with two arguments the first specifies the scale factor for x, the second
	for y. Again scaling will be about the center point
      <LI>

    In the first format a line cap of "butt" and line join of "round" are
    implied.<BR>
    A value of 1 for remove internal/external will remove the internal contour,
    a value of 2 will remove the external contour.
  <DT>
    Outline(width)
  <DD>
    Strokes all selected characters with a stroke of the specified width (internal
    to the characters). The bounding box of the character will not change. In
    other words it produces what the mac calls the "Outline Style".
  <DT>
    Inline(width,gap)
  <DD>
    Produces an outline as above, and then shrinks the character so that it fits
    inside the outline. In other words, it produces an inlined character.
  <DT>
    Shadow(angle,outline-width,shadow-width)
  <DD>
    Converts the selected characters into shadowed versions of themselves.

    Simplify()<BR>
    Simplify(flags,error[,tan_bounds[,bump_size]])
  <DD>
    With no arguments it does the obvious. If flags is -1 it does a Cleanup,
    otherwise flags should be a bitwise or of
    <UL>
      <LI>
	1 -- Slopes may change at the end points.
      <LI>
	2 -- Points which are extremum may be removed
      <LI>
	4 -- Corner points may be smoothed into curves
      <LI>
	8 -- Smoothed points should be snapped to a horizontal or vertical tangent
	if they are close
      <LI>
	16 -- Remove bumps from lines
    </UL>
    <P>
    The error argument is the number of pixels by which the modified path is
    allowed to stray from the true path.<BR>
    The tan_bounds argument specifies the angle between the curves at which smoothing
    will stop<BR>
    And bump_size gives the maximum distance a bump can move from the line and
    still be smoothed out.

  <DD>
    Allows you to add an Advanced Typography feature to a single selected character.
    The first argument may be either: Position, Pair, Substitution, AltSubs,
    MultSubs or Ligature. The second argument should be a script-lang list where
    each 4-character script name is followed by a comma seperated list of 4 character
    language names (with the languages enclosed in curly braces). As:<BR>
    <CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; grek{dflt} latn{dflt,VIT ,ROM }</CODE><BR>
    The third arg should be a 4 character opentype feature tag (or apple
    feature/setting). The fourth argument should be the otf flags (or -1 to make
    PfaEdit guess appropriate flags). The remaining argument(s) vary depending
    on the value of the first (type) argument. For Position tags there are 4
    integral arguments which specify how this feature modifies the metrics of
    this character. For Pair type the next argument is the name of the other
    character in the pair followed by 8 integral arguments, the first 4 specify
    the changes in positioning to the first character, the next four the changes
    for the second char. For substitution tags the fifth argument is the name
    of another glyph which will replace the current one. For an AltSubs tag the
    argument is a space seperated list of glyph names any of which will replace
    the current one. For a MultSubs the argument is a space seperated list of
    names all of which will replace the current one. For a Ligature the argument
    is a space seperated list of glyph names all of which will be replaced by
    the current glyph.
  <DT>
    RemoveATT(type,script-lang,tag)
  <DD>
    Removes any feature tags which match the arguments (which are essentially
    the same as above, except that any of them may be "*" which will match anything).
  <DT>
    AddAnchorClass(name,type,script-lang,tag,flags,merge-with)
  <DD>
    These mirror the values of the Anchor class dialog of Element-&gt;Font Info.
    The first argument should be a utf8 encoded name for the anchor class. The
    second should be one of the strings "default", "mk-mk", or "cursive". The
    third should be a script-lang string like:<BR>
    <CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; grek{dflt} latn{dflt,VIT ,ROM }</CODE><BR>
    The fourth arg should be a 4 character opentype feature tag. The fifth argument
    should be the otf flags (or -1 to make PfaEdit guess appropriate flags).
    The sixth and last argument should be the name of another AnchorClass to
    be merged into the same lookup (or a null string if this class merges with
    no other class yet).
  <DT>
    RemoveAnchorClass(name)
  <DD>
    Removes the named AnchorClass (and all associated points) from the font.
  <DT>
    AddAnchorPoint(name,type,x,y[,lig-index])
  <DD>
    Adds an AnchorPoint to the currently selected character. The first argument
    is the name of the AnchorClass. The second should be one of the strings:
    "mark", "basechar", "baselig", "basemark", "cursentry" or "cursexit". The
    next two values specify the location of the point. The final argument is
    only present for things of type "baselig".

    MergeFonts(other-font-name[,flags])
  <DD>
    Loads other-font-name, and extracts any characters from it which are not
    in the current font and moves them to the current font. The flags argument
    is the same as that for Open. Currently the only relevant flag is to say
    that you do have a lisence to use a font with fstype=2.

  <DT>
    AutoWidth(spacing)
  <DD>
    Guesses at the widths of all selected characters so that two adjacent "I"
    characters will appear to be spacing em-units apart. (if spacing is the negative

  <DT>
    AutoKern(spacing,threshold[,kernfile])
  <DD>
    (AutoKern doesn't work well in general)<BR>
    Guesses at kerning pairs by looking at all selected characters, or if a kernfile

  The <A NAME="Execute">Execute</A> Script dialog
</H2>
<P>
This dialog allows you to type a script directly in to PfaEdit and then run
it. Of course the most common case is that you'll have a script file somewhere
that you want to execute, so there's a button [Call] down at the bottom of
the dlg. Pressing [Call] will bring up a file picker dlg looking for files
with the extension *.pe (you can change that by typing a wildcard sequence
and pressing the [Filter] button). After you have selected your scipt the
appropriate text to text to invoke it will be placed in the text area.

The current font of the script will be set to whatever font you invoked it
from.
<H2>
  The Scripts <A NAME="menu">Menu</A>

<P>
You can use the preference dialog to create a list of frequently used scripts.
Invoke <A HREF="prefs.html#scripts">File-&gt;Preferences</A> and select the
Scripts tag. In this dialog are ten possible entries, each one should have

run.
<P>
After you have set up your preferences you can invoke scripts from the font
view, either directly from the menu (File-&gt;Scripts-&gt;&lt;your name&gt;)
or by a hot key. The first script you added will be invoked by Cnt-Alt-1,
