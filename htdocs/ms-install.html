  <P>
  You must insure that you have <A HREF="http://www.cygwin.com/">cygwin</A>
  installed on your system. Cygwin is free. (cygwin makes MS Windows look enough
  like unix to allow fontforge to run there).
  <UL>
    <LI>
      First download the setup.exe program from
      <A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</A>
    <LI>
      Run it. It will ask you what components of cygwin you wish to install
    <LI>
      You will need the base components, the X window system, xorg-x11-base, and
      xterm (NOTE: These are separate packages)
    <LI>
      Once you have cygwin installed, start it. This should give you a terminal
      window running bash (a unix shell)
  </UL>
  <H3>
    <A NAME="Obtaining">Obtaining</A> one of my pre-built packages
  </H3>
  <P>
  I post a cygwin install package on
  <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=103338&amp;package_id=111040">sourceforge's
  file release system</A>. There's a certain amount of pother involved in using
  the file release system, but you get the file eventually.
  <UL>
    <LI>
      If you follow the
      <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=103338&amp;package_id=111040">link
      above </A>you will end up on a page showing many releases of FontForge for
      many systems<BR>
      in most cases you will want the most recent release.
    <LI>
      Then click on the executable package you want to download:
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  The cygwin release will be called something like
	  "fontforge_cygwin-200xxxxx.tar.bz2
      </UL>
    <LI>
      Then you have the joy of choosing a mirror site (pick one that's on the same
      continent you are) and click on the little icon in the download column
    <LI>
      Then you wait. After a bit you get another copy of this same page. After
      an even longer time your browser notices that you've started a download.
  </UL>
  <H3>
    <A NAME="install">Installing</A>
  </H3>
  <P>
  I have no idea where your browser put the package you have just downloaded.
  This is unfortunate as I can't tell you exactly what to do next. But find
  the package (often it's on the desktop) and then move it into
  C:\cygwin\home\&lt;username&gt;. (where &lt;username&gt; is whatever name
  cygwin gave you)
  <UL>
    <LI>
      Then open a cygwin window (by clicking on the cygwin icon)
    <LI>
      With luck you will now be in the directory containing the package you downloaded.
    <LI>
      Now type (do not type the "$"):
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<PRE>$ bunzip2 fontforge_cygwin-*.tar.bz2
$ tar xf fontforge_cygwin-*.tar
$ cd fontforge
$ ./doinstall
</PRE>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <LI>
      Then edit the file ~/.bashrc by (again do not type "$", use control-D (^D)
      to end):
    <LI>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<PRE>$ cat &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/bin ; export PATH
MANPATH=${MANPATH:-}:/usr/local/man ; export MANPATH
^D
</PRE>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <LI>
      Then each time you want to run fontforge, type:
    <LI>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<PRE>$ xinit
</PRE>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <LI>
      This should bring up X in a large window that covers the screen and within
      that should be a subwindow, an xterm, running bash.
    <LI>
      From the xterm you first start a window manager
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<PRE>$ twm &amp;
</PRE>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <LI>
      And then you should be able start FontForge.
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<PRE>$ fontforge -new
</PRE>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
  </UL>

  <P>
  <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Caveat: </STRONG></FONT>cygwin has a different
  approach to the file system than Windows. A filename like
  <CODE>C:\windows\fonts\arial.ttf </CODE>will be called
  <CODE>/cygdrive/c/windows/fonts/arial.ttf </CODE>under cygwin (backslashes
  are replaced by slashes, and the initial drive "<CODE>C:</CODE>" becomes
  "<CODE>/cygdrive/c</CODE>".
  <P>
  Similarly a cygwin filename
  "<CODE>/home/&lt;username&gt;/myfont.ttf</CODE>" becomes
  "<CODE>C:\cygwin\home\&lt;username&gt;\myfont.ttf</CODE>"
  <P>
  <STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red">Caveat</FONT>:</STRONG> Do <STRONG>NOT</STRONG>
  try to install a font by using fontforge to write the font directly to the
  Windows\Fonts directory. This doesn't work. Windows needs to do some magic
  when installing a font that it can't do if fontforge writes directly there.
  Instead have fontforge create the font somewhere else and then use Windows'
  own drag &amp; drop technique to move the font from there into Windows\Fonts.
  <P>
  <STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red">Caveat</FONT>:</STRONG> I've been told that on
  Win 98 you need to have "Microsoft Network Login" installed to run X. I never
  found this to be true myself, but if you have problems it might be something
  to try.
