  <DT>
    <A NAME="InsBefore">Insert Char Before...</A><BR>
    <A NAME="InsAfter">Insert Char After...</A>
  <DD>
    In the metrics view this brings up a dialog similar to the previous one allowing
    you to enter a glyph by name or encoding either before or after the currently
    selected position.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="FindInFV">Find In Font View</A>
  <DD>
    In the outline, bitmap and metrics views this will scroll the associated
    font view so that the current character is displayed (and selected) in the
    fontview.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Encoded">Encoded</A> View
  <DD>
    Only in the font view. If this is selected then the font is displayed with
    its normal encoding
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Compacted">Compacted</A> View
  <DD>
    Only in the font view. If this is selected then the font is displayed in
    a compacted form where there are no empty glyph cells in the display.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="ShowATT">Show ATT</A>
  <DD>
    Only in the font view. Brings up a <A HREF="showatt.html">dlg</A> showing

  <DT>
    Combinations
  <DD>
    A submenu containing
    <DL>
      <DT>
	<A NAME="KernPairs">Kern Pairs</A>
      <DD>
	This <A HREF="kernpairs.html">brings up a dialog showing all kerning pairs
	</A>in the current font (or, if invoked from the outline character view,

	pairs here too.
      <DT>
	<A NAME="AnchoredPairs">Anchored Pairs</A>
      <DD>

	this font and an entry "All". You may choose to see all combinations of
	characters from a given anchor class, or all combinations from all anchored
	classes.
	<P>
	If invoked from the outline character view it will provide a list of all
	anchored combinations involving that character.
      <DT>
	<A NAME="Ligatures">Ligatures</A>
      <DD>
	This brings up a dialog showing the names of all ligatures and of the characters
	that compose them (if invoked from the outline character view, a list of
	all ligatures containing that character). Double clicking on an entry will
	bring up a window showing that ligature.
    </DL>
  <DT>
    <A NAME="HMetrics">View H. Metrics</A>...
  <DD>
    In the font view this will control which of the the horizontal metrics lines
    are draw across the displayed glyphs. In the outline character view the same
    functionality is available from one of the palettes.
    <A HREF="fontview.html#metrics">See the font view for more information</A>
  <DT>
    <A NAME="VMetrics">View V. Metrics</A>...
  <DD>
    In the font view this will control which of the vertical metrics lines are
    draw across the displayed glyphs. In the outline character view the same
    functionality is available from one of the palettes. (This will be greyed
    out if your font does not have vertical metrics in it).
    <A HREF="fontview.html#metrics">See the font view for more information</A>
  <DT>
    <A NAME="px24">24 pixel </A>outline
  <DD>
    In the font view you may choose how large you want the rasterized representation
    of the outline view to be. The default is to rasterize it on a 24 pixel block.
    If this item is checked then a 24 pixel version of the outline font is displayed,
    selecting it will display a 24 pixel version of the font.<BR>
    (Exactly one em-square of the character will be displayed, if the character
    extends above the ascent or below the descent those features will be clipped)
  <DT>
    <A NAME="px36">36 pixel </A>outline
  <DD>
    Similar to the above but for a 36 pixel version.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="px48">48 pixel </A>outline
  <DD>
    Similar to the above but for a 48 pixel version.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="px72">72 pixel </A>outline
  <DD>
    Similar to the above but for a 72 pixel version.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="px96">96 pixel </A>outline
  <DD>
    Similar to the above but for a 96 pixel version.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="AntiAlias">AntiAlias</A>
  <DD>
    Only in the font and metrics view. Toggles between whether the font displayed
    in the view is a bitmapped font or an anti-aliased font. An Anti-aliased
    font shows levels of grey rather than just black and white. It often looks
    better than a bitmap, but it is slower to generate and draw.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Vertical">Vertical</A>
  <DD>
    Only in the metrics view. Toggles between displaying horizontal and vertical
    metrics. (Only available if Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;General-&gt;Has Vertical
    Metrics is set).
  <DT>
    <A NAME="FitToEm">Fit To Em</A>
  <DD>
    Only in the font view. The fontview will either display characters scaled
    so that the font's bounding box fits in the window, or so that the em fits
    in the window. The advantage of the first method is that you see all of each
    character, the advantage of the second is that you can see how the letter
    sizes compare from font to font.
    <P>
    <SMALL>(This is something of a simplification. In bounding box mode the displayed
    font is scaled so that the vertical size (as found in the bounding box) fits
    it the window. Very wide characters will still not fit horizontally. Also
    the scaling is not updated when characters change, if you have changed the
    maximum bounds of the font you might want to force a rescale by toggling
    this mode)</SMALL>
  <DT>
    &lt;list of <A NAME="bitmaps">bitmap</A> pixel sizes, if any&gt;
  <DD>
    In the font view or metrics view there is a list of all generated bitmap
    fonts. You may select to have one of them displayed in the view rather than
    a rasterized version of the outline font. If one is checked then that one
    is currently displayed, if you select one then it will be displayed.<BR>
    In CID keyed fonts this list will not be present.<BR>
    If your font database includes some greymap fonts then these will be listed
    here too, as usual they will be displayed as
    &lt;pixel-size&gt;@&lt;bits-per-pixel&gt;
  <DT>
    Show/Hide <A NAME="Grid">Grid</A>
  <DD>
    In the Metrics View there is no layers palette. This entry allows you to
    turn on or off the lines marking the edges of the characters on display.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Outline">Outline</A>
  <DD>
    In the Metrics View this will be checked when the outline font is bring
    displayed. Selecting it will display the outline font (rather than a bitmap
    font).
  <DT>
    Show/Hide <A NAME="Points">Points</A>
  <DD>
    This hides or displays the points in the outline character view.
  <DT>
    Mark <A NAME="Extrema">Extrema</A>
  <DD>
    In postscript fonts there should (in almost all cases) be no splines where
    the horizontal or vertical points at extrema are not endpoints. This setting
    will mark what points are at extrema by coloring them a dull purple to remind
    you that you should not delete them.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Fill">Fill</A>
  <DD>
    In the Outline view this fills in the character outline as you edit it. (this
    can be very slow. If the character is too big (too magnified) then filling
    will not be done).
  <DT>
    <A NAME="ShowGridFit">Show Grid Fit</A>
  <DD>
    In the Outline view and only if the freetype library is available. Brings
    up a <A HREF="charview.html#GridFit">dialog</A> which allows you to control
    whether a grid fit version of the splines in the font is displayed.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Bigger">Bigger</A> Pixel Size
  <DD>
    In the bitmap view this displays the current character in next larger bitmap
    font (if there is one)
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Smaller">Smaller</A> Pixel Size
  <DD>
    In the bitmap view this displays the current character in next smaller bitmap
    font (if there is one)
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Palettes">Palettes</A>
  <DD>
    <DL>
      <DT>
	<A NAME="Tools">Tools</A>
      <DD>
	If this item is checked then the tools palette (in the outline and bitmap
	views) is visible. Selecting it toggles whether the palette is visible or
	not.
      <DT>
	<A NAME="Layers">Layers</A>
      <DD>
	If this item is checked then the layers palette (in the outline and bitmap
	views) is visible. Selecting it toggles whether the palette is visible or
	not.
      <DT>
	<A NAME="Shades">Shades</A>
      <DD>
	Only in the bitmap view, and only if editing grey-scale (anti-aliased) fonts.
	Controls whether the shades of grey palette is visible or not.
      <DT>
	<A NAME="Dock">Dock</A> Palettes
      <DD>
	Allows you to control whether you want the palettes free standing or docked
	in the current view.<BR>
	The window manager under gnome does not handle this properly. If you want
	docked palettes under gnome: Open a window with palettes, select docked palettes
	(the palettes will not dock), close the window, reopen the window. The palettes
	are now docked and should be from here on.
    </DL>
  <DT>
    Show/Hide <A NAME="Rulers">Rulers</A>
  <DD>
    In the Character Outline View toggles whether rulers appear at the top and
    to the left of the editing area.
