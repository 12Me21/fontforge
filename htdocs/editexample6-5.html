  <P>
  OpenType and Apple fonts both provide contextual features. These are features
  which only take place in a given context and are essential for typesetting
  Indic and Arabic scripts. In OpenType a context is specified by a set of
  patterns that are tested against the glyph stream of a document. If a pattern
  matches then any substitutions it defines will be applied. In an Apple font,
  the context is specified by a state machine -- a mini program which parses
  and transforms the glyph stream.
  <P>
  Conditional features may involve substitutions, ligatures or kerning (and
  some more obscure behaviors). I am going to provide an example here of a
  contextual substitution.
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="bed-script.png" WIDTH="259" HEIGHT="81" ALIGN="Right">Instead of
  an Indic or Arabic example, let us take something I'm more familiar with,
  the problem of typesetting a latin script font where the letters ``b,'' ``o,''
  ``v'' and ``w'' join their following letter near the x-height, while all
  other letters join near the baseline. Thus we need two variants for each
  glyph, one that joins (on the left) at the baseline (the default variant)
  and one which joins at the x-height. Let us call this second set of letters
  the ``high'' letters and name them ``a.high,'' ``b.high'' and so forth.

      <TD >The following example does not work! The font tables produced by it
	are all correct, but the designers of OpenType decided that the latin script
	does not need complex conditional features and implementations of OpenType
	do not support them for latin. This is not even mentioned in the standard,
	but is hidden away in supplemental information on microsoft's site.
	<P>
	Why do I provide an example which doesn't work? It's the best I can do. If
	I knew enough about Indic or Arabic typesetting I would provide an example
	for those scripts. But I don't. The procedures are the same. If you follow
	them for some other scripts they will work.
	<P>
	On some systems and in some applications this example can be made to work
	by replacing the 'calt' feature tag (conditional alternatives) with a Required
	tag.</TD>
    </TR>
  </TABLE>
  <P>
  We divide the set of possible glyphs into three classes: the letters ``bovw'',
  all other letters, and all other glyphs. We need to create two patterns,
  the first will match a glyph in the ``bovw'' class followed by a glyph in
  the ``bovw'' class, while the second will match a glyph in the ``bovw'' class
  followed by any other letter. If either of these matches the second glyph
  should be transformed into its high variant.
  <P>
  The first thing we must do is create a simple substitution mapping each low
  letter to its high variant. Let us call this substitution by the four character
  OpenType tag ``high.'' To define the substitution we use
  <A HREF="charinfo.html#substitution">Element -&gt; Glyph Info </A>as
  <A HREF="editexample6.html#Variants">before</A> except that here we use the
  special ``script / language'' called ``--- Nested ---'' (an option in the
  pulldown menu).
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="ott1.png" WIDTH="261" HEIGHT="328" ALIGN="Right">The tricky part
  is defining the context. This is done with the Contextual tab in the
  <A HREF="fontinfo.html#Contextual">Element -&gt; Font Info</A> dialog, revealing
  five different types of contextual behavior, we are interested in contextual
  chaining substitutions.
  <P>
  You can add a new entry by pressing the [New] button. This brings up a series
  of dialogs, the first requests a four character OpenType tag and a script
  / language (much as we <A HREF="charinfo.html#Feature-Tag">saw earlier</A>).
  <P>
  In this example we are using 'calt'. That seems an apropriate tag, until
  you discover that it is not implemented for the Latin script. Indeed there
  seems to be no appropriate feature that is implemented for Latin. The example
  will produce a font, which while syntactically correct, will never do anything.
  It is frustrating that OpenType provides the capabilities needed to do wonderous
  things, and then to find that
  <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenType%20Dev/standard/shaping.mspx">MicroSoft</A>
  doesn't let that happen in Latin.
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="ott2_5.png" WIDTH="329" HEIGHT="263" ALIGN="Left">The next dialog
  allows you to specify the overall format of the substitution. We want a class
  based system -- we've already mentioned what the glyph classes will be
  above.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="ott3.png" WIDTH="330" HEIGHT="357" ALIGN="Right">The next dialog
  finally shows something interesting. At the top are a series of patterns
  to match and substitutions that will be applied if the string matches. Underneath
  that are the glyph classes that this substitution uses. A contextual chaining
  dialog divides the glyph stream into three categories: those glyphs before
  the current glyph (these are called backtracking glyphs), the current glyph
  itself (you may specify more than one), and this (these) glyphs may have
  simple substitutions applied to them, and finally glyphs after the current
  glyph (these are called lookahead glyphs).
  <P>
  Each category of glyphs may divide glyphs into a different set of classes,
  but in this example we use the same classes for all categories (this makes
  it easier to convert the substitution to Apple's format). The first line
  (in the ``List of lists'' field) should be read thus: If a backtracking glyph
  (the glyph before the current one) in class 1 is followed by the current
  glyph in class 2, then location 0 --the only location -- in the match string
  (that is the current glyph) should have simple substitution `high' applied
  to it.
  <P>
  If you look at the glyph class definitions you will see that class 1 includes
  those glyphs which must be followed by a high variant, so this seems reasonable.
  <P>
  The second line is similar except that it matches glyphs in class 1. Looking
  at the class definitions we see that classes 1 &amp; 2 include all the letters,
  so these two lines mean that if any letter follows one of ``bovw'' then that
  letter should be converted to its `high' variant. <BR CLEAR=ALL>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="ott4.png" WIDTH="330" HEIGHT="357" ALIGN="Left">To edit a glyph
  class simply double click on it. To create a new one press the [New] button
  (under the class list). This produces another dialog showing all the names
  of all the glyphs in the current class. Pressing the [Select] button will
  set the selection in the font window to match the glyphs in the class, while
  the [Set] button will do the reverse and set the class to the selection in
  the font window. These provide a short cut to typing in a lot of glyph names.
  <P>
  Pressing the [Next] button defines the class and returns to the overview
  dialog. <BR CLEAR=ALL>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="ott3.png" WIDTH="330" HEIGHT="357" ALIGN="Right">To edit a pattern
  double click on it, or to create a new one press the [New] button (under
  the List of lists). Again the pattern string is divided into three categories,
  <IMG SRC="ott5.png" WIDTH="330" HEIGHT="357" ALIGN="Left">those glyphs before
  the current one, the current one itself, and any glyphs after the current
  one. You choose which category of the pattern you are editing with the tabs
  at the top of the dialog.
  <P>
  Underneath these is the subset of the pattern that falls within the current
  category, the classes defined for this category, and finally the substitutions
  for the current glyph(s). Clicking on one of the classes will add the class
  number to the pattern.
  <P>
  To edit a substitution double click on it, or to create a new one press the
  [New] button (under ``An ordered list...''). The sequence number specifies
  which glyph among the current glyphs should be modified, and the tag specifies
  a four character substitution name<BR CLEAR=ALL>
  <P>
  <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>A warning about contextual
  behavior:</STRONG></FONT> Not all software supports them. And even more confusing
  software may support them for some scripts and not for others.
  <H3>
    <A NAME="Apple">Apple</A> advanced typography
  </H3>
  <P>
  Apple specifies a context with a finite state machine, which is essentially
  a tiny program that looks at the glyph stream and decides what substitutions
  to apply. Each state machine has a set of glyph class definitions (just as
  in the OpenType example), and a set of states. The process begins in state
  0 at the start of the glyph stream. The computer determines what class the
  current glyph is in and then looks at the current state to see how it will
  behave when given input from that class. The behavior includes the ability
  to change to a different state, advancing the input to the next glyph, applying
  a substitution to either the current glyph or a previous one (the ``marked''
  glyph).
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="sm-picture.png" WIDTH="386" HEIGHT="130" ALIGN="Right">Using the
  same example of a latin script font... We again need a simple substitution
  to convert each letter into its high alternate. The process is the same as
  it was for OpenType, and indeed we can use the same substitution. Again we
  divide the glyphs into three classes (Apple gives us some extra classes whether
  we want them or no, but conceptually we use the same three classes as in
  the OpenType example). We want a state machine with two states (again Apple
  gives us an extra state for free, but we shall ignore that), one is the start
  state (the base state -- where nothing changes), and the other is the state
  where we've just read a glyph from the ``bovw'' class. <BR CLEAR=ALL>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="asm1.png" WIDTH="261" HEIGHT="323" ALIGN="Left"> Again we use the
  <A HREF="fontinfo.html#Mac-SM">Element -&gt; Font Info </A>dialog and the
  Mac SM tag to look at the contextual substitutions available. Again there
  are several types of contextual behavior, and we are interested in contextual
  substitutions. Double clicking on a state machine, or pressing the [New]
  button provides an overview of the given state machine.
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="asm2.png" WIDTH="309" HEIGHT="381" ALIGN="Right"> At the top of
  the dialog we see a field specifying the feature / setting of the machine,
  this is Apple's equivalent of the OpenType 4 character feature tag. Under
  this is a set of class definitions, and at the bottom is a representation
  of the state machine itself. <BR CLEAR=Left>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="asm3.png" WIDTH="309" HEIGHT="206" ALIGN="Left">Double clicking
  on a class brings up a dialog similar to that used in OpenType<BR CLEAR=Right>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="asm4.png" WIDTH="196" HEIGHT="307" ALIGN="Right"> Clicking on a
  transition in the state machine (there is a transition for each state / class
  combination) produces a transition dialog. This controls how the state machine
  behaves when it is in a given state and receives a glyph in a given class.
  In this example it is in state 2 (which means it has already read a ``bovw''
  glyph), and it has received a glyph in class 4 (which is another ``bovw''
  glyph). In this case the next state will be state 2 again (we will have just
  read a new ``bovw'' glyph), read another glyph and apply the ``high''
  substitution to the current glyph.
  <P>
  At the bottom of the dialog are a series of buttons that allow you to navigate
  through the transitions of the state machine.
  <P>
  Pressing [OK] many times will extract you from this chain of dialogs and
  add a new state machine to your font.
