    <A NAME="Conditional">Conditional</A> Features
  </H2>
  <P>
  OpenType and Apple fonts both provide contextual features. These are features
  which only take place in a given context and are essential for typesetting
  Indic and Arabic scripts. In OpenType a context is specified by a set of
  patterns that are tested against the glyph stream of a document. If a pattern
  matches then any substitutions it defines will be applied. In an Apple font,
  the context is specified by a state machine -- a mini program which parses
  and transforms the glyph stream.
  <P>
  Conditional features may involve substitutions, ligatures or kerning (and
  some more obscure behaviors). First I shall provide an example of a contextual
  substitution, later of <A HREF="editexample6-5.html#Greek">contextual
  ligatures</A>.
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="bed-script.png" WIDTH="259" HEIGHT="81" ALIGN="Right">Instead of
  an Indic or Arabic example, let us take something I'm more familiar with,
  the problem of typesetting a latin script font where the letters ``b,'' ``o,''
  ``v'' and ``w'' join their following letter near the x-height, while all
  other letters join near the baseline. Thus we need two variants for each
  glyph, one that joins (on the left) at the baseline (the default variant)
  and one which joins at the x-height. Let us call this second set of letters
  the ``high'' letters and name them ``a.high,'' ``b.high'' and so forth.

      <TD >The following example may not work! The font tables produced by it are
	all correct, but the designers of OpenType (or its implementors) decided
	that the latin script does not need complex conditional features and many
	implementations of OpenType do not support them for latin. This is not even
	mentioned in the standard, but is hidden away in supplemental information
	on microsoft's site.
	<P>
	Why do I provide an example which doesn't work? It's the best I can do. If
	I knew enough about Indic or Arabic typesetting I would provide an example
	for those scripts. But I don't. The procedures are the same. If you follow
	them for some other scripts they will work.
	<P>
	On some systems and in some applications 'calt' is supported for latn and
	this example will work. On other systems/applications the example can be
	made to work by replacing the 'calt' feature tag (conditional alternatives)
	with a Required tag (but I gather that is now deprecated).</TD>
    </TR>
  </TABLE>
  <P>
  We divide the set of possible glyphs into three classes: the letters ``bovw'',
  all other letters, and all other glyphs. We need to create two patterns,
  the first will match a glyph in the ``bovw'' class followed by another glyph
  in the ``bovw'' class, while the second will match a glyph in the ``bovw''
  class followed by any other letter. If either of these matches the second
  glyph should be transformed into its high variant.
  <UL>
    <LI>
      [bovw] [bovw] =&gt; Apply a substitution to second letter
    <LI>
      [bovw] &lt;any other letter&gt; =&gt; Apply a substitution to the second
      letter
  </UL>
  <P>
  (You might wonder why I don't just have a class of all letters and use one
  rule instead of two? Because in this case all my classes must be disjoint,
  I mayn't have one glyph appearing in two classes).
  <P>
  The first thing we must do is create a simple substitution mapping each low
  letter to its high variant. This is a "Simple Substitution" lookup, but it
  will not be attached to any feature, instead it will be invoked by a contextual
  lookup. Let us call this lookup "high". We must (of course) create a subtable
  to go with our lookup, and we can use the [Default with Suffix:] button to
  fill it up with the high variants.
  <P>
  The tricky part is defining the context. This is done by defining yet another
  lookup, a contextual chaining lookup which should be associated with a 'calt'
  feature. And of course we want an associated subtable). This will pop up
  a series of dialogs to edit a contextual subtable
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="ott2_5.png" WIDTH="329" HEIGHT="263" ALIGN="Left">The first dialog
  allows you to specify the overall format of the substitution. We want a class
  based system -- we've already mentioned what the glyph classes will
  be.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="ott3.png" WIDTH="330" HEIGHT="357" ALIGN="Right">The next dialog
  finally shows something interesting. At the top are a series of patterns
  to match and substitutions that will be applied if the string matches. Underneath
  that are the glyph classes that this substitution uses. A contextual chaining
  dialog divides the glyph stream into three categories: those glyphs before
  the current glyph (these are called backtracking glyphs), the current glyph
  itself (you may specify more than one), and this (these) glyphs may have
  simple substitutions applied to them, and finally glyphs after the current
  glyph (these are called lookahead glyphs).
  <P>
  Each category of glyphs may divide glyphs into a different set of classes,
  but in this example we use the same classes for all categories (this makes
  it easier to convert the substitution to Apple's format). The first line
  (in the ``List of lists'' field) should be read thus: If a backtracking glyph
  (the glyph before the current one) in class 1 is followed by the current
  glyph in class 2, then location 0 --the only location -- in the match string
  (that is the current glyph) should have simple substitution `high' applied
  to it.
  <P>
  If you look at the glyph class definitions you will see that class 1 includes
  those glyphs which must be followed by a high variant, so this seems reasonable.
  <P>
  The second line is similar except that it matches glyphs in class 1. Looking
  at the class definitions we see that classes 1 &amp; 2 include all the letters,
  so these two lines mean that if any letter follows one of ``bovw'' then that
  letter should be converted to its `high' variant. <BR CLEAR=ALL>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="ott4.png" WIDTH="330" HEIGHT="357" ALIGN="Left">To edit a glyph
  class simply double click on it. To create a new one press the [New] button
  (under the class list). This produces another dialog showing all the names
  of all the glyphs in the current class. Pressing the [Select] button will
  set the selection in the font window to match the glyphs in the class, while
  the [Set] button will do the reverse and set the class to the selection in
  the font window. These provide a short cut to typing in a lot of glyph names.
  <P>
  Pressing the [Next] button defines the class and returns to the overview
  dialog. <BR CLEAR=ALL>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="ott3.png" WIDTH="330" HEIGHT="357" ALIGN="Right">To edit a pattern
  double click on it, or to create a new one press the [New] button (under
  the List of lists). Again the pattern string is divided into three categories,
  <IMG SRC="ott5.png" WIDTH="330" HEIGHT="357" ALIGN="Left">those glyphs before
  the current one, the current one itself, and any glyphs after the current
  one. You choose which category of the pattern you are editing with the tabs
  at the top of the dialog.
  <P>
  Underneath these is the subset of the pattern that falls within the current
  category, the classes defined for this category, and finally the substitutions
  for the current glyph(s). Clicking on one of the classes will add the class
  number to the pattern.
  <P>
  To edit a substitution double click on it, or to create a new one press the
  [New] button (under ``An ordered list...''). The sequence number specifies
  which glyph among the current glyphs should be modified, and the tag specifies
  a four character substitution name<BR CLEAR=ALL>

  <H3>
    <A NAME="Apple">Apple</A> advanced typography
  </H3>
  <P>
  Apple specifies a context with a finite state machine, which is essentially
  a tiny program that looks at the glyph stream and decides what substitutions
  to apply. Each state machine has a set of glyph class definitions (just as
  in the OpenType example), and a set of states. The process begins in state
  0 at the start of the glyph stream. The computer determines what class the
  current glyph is in and then looks at the current state to see how it will
  behave when given input from that class. The behavior includes the ability
  to change to a different state, advancing the input to the next glyph, applying
  a substitution to either the current glyph or a previous one (the ``marked''
  glyph).
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="sm-picture.png" WIDTH="386" HEIGHT="130" ALIGN="Right">Using the
  same example of a latin script font... We again need a simple substitution
  to convert each letter into its high alternate. The process is the same as
  it was for OpenType, and indeed we can use the same substitution. Again we
  divide the glyphs into three classes (Apple gives us some extra classes whether
  we want them or no, but conceptually we use the same three classes as in
  the OpenType example). We want a state machine with two states (again Apple
  gives us an extra state for free, but we shall ignore that), one is the start
  state (the base state -- where nothing changes), and the other is the state
  where we've just read a glyph from the ``bovw'' class. <BR CLEAR=ALL>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="asm1.png" WIDTH="439" HEIGHT="427" ALIGN="Left"> Apple Advanced
  Typography does not quite fit into the OpentType concepts of lookups and
  features, but it is close enough that I sort of force it to. So once again
  we create a GSUB lookup. This time the lookup type is "Mac Contextual State
  Machine", and the feature is actually a mac feature/setting, two numbers.
  When we create a new subtable of this type we get a state machine dialog,
  as shown below.
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="asm2.png" WIDTH="309" HEIGHT="381" ALIGN="Right"> At the top of
  the dialog we see a set of class definitions, and at the bottom is a
  representation of the state machine itself. <BR CLEAR=Left>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="asm3.png" WIDTH="309" HEIGHT="206" ALIGN="Left">Double clicking
  on a class brings up a dialog similar to that used in OpenType<BR CLEAR=Right>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="asm4.png" WIDTH="196" HEIGHT="307" ALIGN="Right"> Clicking on a
  transition in the state machine (there is a transition for each state / class
  combination) produces a transition dialog. This controls how the state machine
  behaves when it is in a given state and receives a glyph in a given class.
  In this example it is in state 2 (which means it has already read a ``bovw''
  glyph), and it has received a glyph in class 4 (which is another ``bovw''
  glyph). In this case the next state will be state 2 again (we will have just
  read a new ``bovw'' glyph), read another glyph and apply the ``high''
  substitution to the current glyph.
  <P>
  At the bottom of the dialog are a series of buttons that allow you to navigate
  through the transitions of the state machine.
  <P>
  Pressing [OK] many times will extract you from this chain of dialogs and
  add a new state machine to your font.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
  <H2>
    OpenType, <A NAME="Greek">Greek</A> ligatures
  </H2>
  <P>
  Greek has a character (U+03D7) which is equivalent to the Latin ampersand.
  Just as the ampersand is (originally) a ligature of "E" and "t", so U+03D7
  is a ligature of "kappa" and "iota". However this ligature should only be
  used if "kappa" and "iota" make up a word unto themselves, it should not
  be used for more normal occurances of the two within a longer word.
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="kappa_iota-lookup.png" WIDTH="239" HEIGHT="315" ALIGN="Right">So
  the first thing to do is create the ligature itself. Add the glyph for U+03D7,
  and then create a ligature lookup and subtable (with
  <CODE><A HREF="fontinfo.html#Lookups">Element-&gt;Font
  Info-&gt;Lookups)</A></CODE> to bind U+03D7 to be a ligature of "kappa" and
  "iota". This lookup will never be used directly -- only under the control
  of another, a conditional feature -- so we don't give it a feature
  tag.<BR>
  <IMG SRC="kappa_iota-subtable.png" WIDTH="292" HEIGHT="172">
  <P>
  Next the conditional bit.
  <P>
  I'm going to use the notation &lt;letters&gt; to represent a class consisting
  of all greek letters.
  <OL>
    <LI>
      &lt;letters&gt; kappa iota =&gt; no substitution
    <LI>
      kappa iota &lt;letters&gt; =&gt; no substitution
    <LI>
      kappa iota =&gt; apply the ligature "WORD"
  </OL>
  <P>
  <SMALL>(Now as I read the standard all these rules could be put into one
  subtable, and the font validation tools I have agree with me -- but the layout
  engines do not. The layout engines seem to insist that each rule live in
  its own subtable. This is inconvenient (the classes must be defined in each
  subtable) but it seems to work.)</SMALL>
  <P>
  These rules will be executed in order, and the first one that matches the
  input text will be the (one and only) rule applied. Consider these three
  strings, <IMG SRC="alphakappaiota.png" WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="12">,
  <IMG SRC="kappaiotatheta.png" WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="12">,
  <IMG SRC="alphakappaiotatheta.png" WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="12"> all contain kappa
  and iota but each contains more letters around them, so none should be replaced
  by the ligature.
  <UL>
    <LI>
      The first string, <IMG SRC="alphakappaiota.png" WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="12">,
      will match the first rule above (it contains letters before the kappa iota
      sequence) and no substitution will be done. It also matches the third rule,
      but we never get that far.
    <LI>
      The second string, <IMG SRC="kappaiotatheta.png" WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="12">,
      will match the second rule above (it contains letters after the sequence)
      and again no substitution will be done. It would match the third rule, but
      we stop with the first match.
    <LI>
      The third string, <IMG SRC="alphakappaiotatheta.png" WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="12">,
      matches all the rules, but since the search stops at the first match, only
      the first rule will be applied, and no substitution will be done.
    <LI>
      The string, <IMG SRC="spacekappaiotaspace.png" WIDTH="29" HEIGHT="12">, matches
      neither of the first two rules but does match the last, so here the ligature
      will be formed.
  </UL>
  <P>
  You might wonder why I don't just have one rule
  <OL>
    <LI>
      &lt;any non-letter&gt; kappa iota &lt;any non-letter&gt; =&gt; apply our
      ligature
  </OL>
  <P>
  It seems much simpler.
  <P>
  Well there's one main reason:
  <UL>
    <LI>
      This does not work if the kappa is at the beginning of the input stream (it
      will not be preceded by any glyphs, but might still need replacing), or iota
      at the end.
  </UL>
  <P>
  Now how do we convert these rules into a contextual lookup?
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="kappa_iota-context.png" WIDTH="246" HEIGHT="315" ALIGN="Left">We
  use <CODE><A HREF="fontinfo.html#Contextual">Element-&gt;Font
  Info-&gt;Lookups-&gt;Add Lookup</A></CODE> to create a new contextual chaining
  lookup. This is the top level lookup and should be bound to a feature tag
  in the Greek script.
  <P>
  We have three rules, each rule lives in its own subtable, so we will create
  three subtables, one for each. The order in which these subtables n the Lookups
  pane is important because that is the order in which the the rules they contain
  will be executed. We must insure that that final rule which actually invokes
  the ligature is the last one executed (and the last one in the
  list).<BR CLEAR=ALL>
