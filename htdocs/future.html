  Currently under development

<UL>
  <LI>
    A command that will allow you to
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Make a character/font bolder
      <LI>
	Extend or Condense a character/font
      <LI>
	Change the X-Height of a font
      <LI>
	Regularize stem widths
    </UL>
  <LI>
    Some vague support for CID keyed opentype fonts
  <LI>
    A Find/Replace command that will allow you to search for features and replace
    them with others<BR>
    The dlg will provide two little drawing panes (one to find, one to replace)
    the program will search for a series of points in the same relative positions
    (possibly translated, flipped or followed backwards) and if found will replace
    it with the the points in the replace window. I see two uses for this:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Change all the serifs in a font from one style to another.
      <LI>
	Search for all inline copies of a glyph and replace each with a reference.
    </UL>

<UL>
  <LI>
    Some kind of support for multiple master fonts
  <LI>
    An editing mode which supports more features that type3 fonts could use (ie.
    multiple colors, strokes, ...)
  <LI>
    hinting of italic serifs in true type output
  <LI>
    proper construction of arabic (right to left) ligatures
  <LI>
    A scroll bar in the metrics view
  <LI>
    Better import of xfig files (a real X-Spline -&gt; Bezier spline converter)
  <LI>
    Mechanism for creating fonts with multiple instances of the same character,
    each slightly different, coupled with a postscript routine which will for
    each character in a string, pick a random version of that character to display.
    An attempt to yield a slight non-uniformity to the font which may make its
    output look more interesting.
