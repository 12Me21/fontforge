    multiple baseline support

    Vertical metrics in embedded ttf bitmaps
  <LI>
    Better import of xfig files (a real X-Spline -&gt; B&eacute;zier spline
    converter)
  <LI>
    Mechanism for creating fonts with multiple instances of the same character,
    each slightly different, coupled with a postscript routine which will for
    each character in a string, pick a random version of that character to display.
    An attempt to yield a slight non-uniformity to the font which may make its
    output look more interesting.
  <LI>
    A better way of aligning things. (need some form of grouping that is actually
    useful)
