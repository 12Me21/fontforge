  <A NAME="Navigating">Navigating to characters.</A>
</H2>
<P>
The font view provides one way of navigating around the characters in a font.
Simple scroll around it until you find the character you need and then double
click on it to open a window looking at that character.
<P>
Typing a character will move to that character.
<P>
However some fonts are huge (Chinese, Japanese and Korean fonts have thousands
or even tens of thousands of characters) and scrolling around the font view
is a an inefficient way of finding your character. <CODE>View-&gt;Goto
</CODE>provides a simple dialog which will allow you to move directly to
any character for which you know the name (or encoding). If your font is
a Unicode font, then this dialog will also allow you to find characters by
block name (ie. Hebrew rather than Aleph).
<P>
The simplist way to navigate is just to go to the next or previous character.
And <CODE>View-&gt;Next Char</CODE> and <CODE>View-&gt;Prev Char</CODE> will
do exactly that.

  <A NAME="Creating-o">Creating </A>the letter "o" -- consistant directions
</H2>
<P>
In the previous example the bitmap of the letter filled the canvas of the
image. And when PfaEdit imported the image it needed to be scaled once in
the program. But usually when you create the image of the letter you have
some idea of how much white space there should be around it. If your images
are exactly one em high then PfaEdit will scale them automatically to be
the right size. So in the following examples all the images have exactly
the right amount of whitespace around them to fit perfectly in an em.
<P>
For the next example double click on the square in the font view that should
contain "o", and import "o_Ambrosia.png" into it.
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING="2">
  <CAPTION>
    Stages in editing "o"
  </CAPTION>
  <TR>
    <TD><IMG SRC="o1.png" WIDTH="190" HEIGHT="287"></TD>
    <TD><IMG SRC="o2.png" WIDTH="190" HEIGHT="287"></TD>
    <TD><IMG SRC="o3.png" WIDTH="190" HEIGHT="287"></TD>
    <TD><IMG SRC="o4.png" WIDTH="190" HEIGHT="287"></TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Notice that the first outline is drawn clockwise and the second
counter-clockwise. This change in drawing direction is important. Both PostScript
and TrueType require that the outer boundry of a character be drawn in a
certain direction (they happen to be oposite from each other, which is a
mild annoyance), within PfaEdit all outer boundries must be drawn clockwise,
while all inner boundries must be drawn counter-clockwise.
<P>
If you fail to alternate directions between outer and inner boundries you
may get results like the one on the left
<IMG SRC="o-baddir.png" WIDTH="51" HEIGHT="28">. If you fail to draw the
outer contour in a clockwise fashion the errors are more subtle, but will
generally result in a less pleasing result once the character has been rasterize.
<P>
The command <CODE><A HREF="elementmenu.html#Correct">Element-&gt;Correct
Direction</A></CODE> will look at each selected contour, figure out whether
it qualifies as an outer or inner contour and will reverse the drawing direction
when the contour is drawn incorrectly.
