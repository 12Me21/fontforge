  Error Recovery
</H1>
<P>
All programs crash, and new programs (like this one) crash a lot.
<P>
Every minute or so PfaEdit looks around and sees if anything has changed
since the last time it checked. If it finds a font that has had changes,
it will save a small file in its private directory (~/.PfaEdit/autosave)
which consists of all changed characters in the changed font.
<P>
When PfaEdit starts up it checks this directory, and if it finds anything
there it attempts to apply those changes to the original font. So if PfaEdit
crashes, or if your machine crashes, the next time you start PfaEdit it will
figure out what you were doing and recover it as best it can.
