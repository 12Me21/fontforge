<DL>
  <DT>
    <A NAME="AutoHint">AutoHint</A>
  <DD>
    Whether glyphs should be automagically hinted before a bitmap glyph is generated
    (improves the quality of the bitmap)
  <DT>
    <A NAME="NewCharset">NewCharset</A>
  <DD>
    The default encoding used to create new fonts. Normally this is ISO 8859-1.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="NewEmSize">NewEmSize</A>
  <DD>
    Specifies the default number of em-units in the em-square. For PostScript
    fonts this should be 1000, for truetype fonts it should be a power of two
    (often 512, 1024 or 2048 will be used).
  <DT>
    <A NAME="NewFontsQuadratic">NewFontsQuadratic</A>
  <DD>
    Splines in fonts may be either in quadratic or cubic format. TrueType fonts
    use quadratic splines while PostScript (and OpenType) fonts use cubic splines.
    When FontForge generates a font it will convert from whatever format is used
    internally to whatever format is required for the font, so there will be
    no problem if this is set incorrectly, but setting it correctly for your
    font means you get a clearer idea of what the outlines will look like.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="LoadedFontsAsNew">LoadedFontsAsNew</A>
  <DD>
    When FontForge reads in a font it will generally keep the splines in the
    format they used in the font (that is quadratic for truetype fonts and cubic
    for postscript). If you set this flag then all loaded fonts will have the
    same file format as that specified by NewFontsQuadratic above.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="GreekNames">GreekNames</A>
  <DD>
    Will cause most new fonts to be created with a greek
    <A HREF="fontinfo.html#Interpretation">interpretation</A>.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="ResourceFile">ResourceFile</A>
  <DD>
    FontForge will read <A HREF="xres.html">X Resources</A> from a property on
    the screen. But sometimes this isn't enough. You set this preference item
    to specify a file from which these resources should be read (those on the
    screen will also be read and will supersede those in the file).
  <DT>
    <A NAME="HelpDir">HelpDir</A>
  <DD>
    FontForge will search this directory for help files when the user presses
    [F1].<BR Clear=all>
</DL>

<IMG SRC="prefs-editing.png" WIDTH="286" HEIGHT="379" ALIGN="Right">
<DL>
  <DT>
    <A NAME="AutoWidthSync">AutoWidthSync</A>
  <DD>
    Whether you want the widths of accented glyphs to track the width of the
    base glyph (so if you modify the width of A then the width of &Agrave; will
    automagically change, if &Agrave; is built as a reference to A and a reference
    to grave)
  <DT>
    <A NAME="AutoLBearingSync">AutoLBearingSync</A>
  <DD>
    Whether you want left side bearings of accented glyphs to track the left
    side bearing of base glyphs (so if you shift A left, then the accent in &Agrave;
    will also be shifted left)
  <DT>
    <A NAME="ItalicConstrained">ItalicConstrained</A>
  <DD>
    Whether constrained motion in the glyph view should allow motion parallel
    to the italic angle as well as horizontal and vertical.
  <DT>
  <DT>
    <A NAME="ArrowMoveSize">ArrowMoveSize</A>
  <DD>
    The number of em-units an arrow key will move a selected point in the glyph
    view.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="SnapDistance">SnapDistance</A>
  <DD>
    The maximum distance at which pointer motion in the glyph view will be snapped
    to an interesting object (ie. a point, baseline, width line, etc.). This
    is measured in pixels.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="JoinSnap">JoinSnap</A>
  <DD>
    The maximum distance between the endpoints of two splines before they will
    join with the Edit-&gt;Join command. This is measured in pixels in the char
    view and em-units elsewhere.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="CopyMetaData">CopyMetaData</A>
  <DD>
    Controls the behavior of Edit-&gt;Copy from the fontview. Normally Copy does
    not copy a glyph's metadata (name, encoding, etc.) but if this is set then
    it will.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="UndoDepth">UndoDepth</A>
  <DD>
    Controls the maximum number of Undoes that may be retained in a glyph. (In
    some rare occasions an Undo will be stored even if this depth is 0)
  <DT>
    <A NAME="StopAtJoin">StopAtJoin</A>
  <DD>
    When dragging points in the outline view, if the end point of one open contour
    is moved onto the end point of another open contour then those two contours
    will join. If you leave this Off then further motion will continue to move
    the points, if you set this to On then FontForge will stop noticing mouse
    movements (it pretends that you released the mouse button). This is useful
    if you hand jitters a little on the mouse.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="UpdateFlex">UpdateFlex</A>
  <DD>
    Figure out what points will be part of flex hints after every change to a
    glyph. Points which are at the center of a flex hint will have a green halo
    drawn around them. The criteria for flex hints are given on pages 72-73 of
    Adobe's
    <A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/PDFS/TN/T1_SPEC.PDF">T1_Spec.pdf</A>.
    This setting can be used to show you when those criteria are not met.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="GlyphAutoGoto">GlyphAutoGoto</A>
  <DD>
    In the glyph window this controls how ff behaves when the user types a normal
    character. If this is On then when a normal character is typed the glyph
    window will shift to display that character, if Off typed characters will
    be ignored.<BR Clear=all>
</DL>
<DL>
  <DT>
    <A NAME="AccentOffsetPercent">AccentOffsetPercent</A>
  <DD>
    The amount of space (as a percentage of the em-square) that should be placed
    between an accent and the glyph below it by the Build Accented Character
    command.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="AccentCenterLowest">AccentCenterLowest</A>
  <DD>
    Whether accents should be positioned over letters based on the center of
    the accent, or on the center of the bottom of the accent.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="CharCenterHighest">CharCenterHighest</A>
  <DD>
    Whether accents should be positioned over letters based on the center of
    of the letter, or on the center of the top of the letter.

  <DT>
    <A NAME="FoundryName">Foundry Name</A>
  <DD>
    Used in generating bdf files (part of the X Windows font naming convention).
  <DT>
    <A NAME="TTFFoundry">TTF Foundry</A>
  <DD>
    Similar to the above except that it is used inside ttf files (the achVendID
    field of the OS/2 table) and is limited to 4 characters.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="XUID-Base">XUID-Base</A>
  <DD>
    The base
    "<A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/xuid.jsp">XUID</A>". Should
    uniquely identify the user's organization. If present then every new font
    will be given an XUID generated by appending a random number to the end of
    this string (which should consist of a set of numbers separated by spaces).
    Whenever a postscript font is generated then this last number will be incremented
    by 1.
    <P>
    I have registered with Adobe and they have assigned FontForge (actually PfaEdit)
    an extended unique id base of [1021]. When you first start FontForge, FontForge
    will itself append a couple of random numbers to this to give you your own
    extended unique id. And individual fonts will get a fourth number added to
    that.
    <P>
    If you want you may
    <A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/xuidregister.jsp">register
    directly with Adobe</A> for your own XUID base.
    <P>
    See also Adobe's comments on
    <A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/uniqueid.jsp">UniqueID</A>s.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="AskBDFResolution">AskBDFResolution</A>
  <DD>
    Normally FontForge will guess at what screen resolution you intend based
    on the pixel size of the font (ie. 17 pixel fonts are usually 100dpi (12pt)
    and 12 pixel fonts are usually 75dpi), but sometimes you will have more esoteric
    desires. Setting this will give you more control, but you have to click through
    another dlg.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="PreferCJKEncoding">PreferCJKEncoding</A>
  <DD>
    This controls the loading of truetype and opentype fonts. If a font contains
    both an unicode encoding subtable and a cjk subtable, then this item allows
    you to pick which one FontForge will choose to decode.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="HintForGen">HintForGen</A>
  <DD>
    Whether glyphs should be automagically hinted before a font is generated.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="AlwaysGenApple">AlwaysGenApple</A>
  <DD>
    If you always want to generate Apple style TTF fonts (and never windows ones)
    then select this item.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="PreserveTables">PreserveTables</A>
  <DD>
    A string containing a list of 4 letter table tags separated by commas. When
    loading an SFNT (ttf/otf) file, any table in the font with one of these tags
    will be preserved without interpretation. (Note: If FontForge thinks it
    understands the table it will parse it rather than preserving
    it).<BR Clear=ALL>
</DL>
<DL>
  <DT>
    <IMG SRC="prefs-apps.png" WIDTH="282" HEIGHT="372" ALIGN="Right"><A NAME="AutotraceArgs">AutotraceArgs</A>
  <DD>
    This allows you to specify any arguments you want passed to the autotrace
    program. Don't try to pass something that will change the input or output
    format or set input or output files.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="AutotraceAsk">AutotraceAsk</A>
  <DD>
    If this is set then each time autotrace is invoked it will ask you for arguments.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="MfArgs">MfArgs</A>
  <DD>
    This is the command passed to the mf (MetaFont) program which controls conversion
    of .mf files into bitmaps.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="MfClearBg">MfClearBg</A>
  <DD>
    Loading a .mf font is a multi step process, first a bitmap font is generated,
    it is loaded into the background, then autotrace is invoked to trace around
    the backgrounds. These background bitmaps can take up a lot of space and
    you may not want them after they have been autotraced. Selecting this entry
    will remove those bitmaps from the font after they have been used.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="MfShowErr">MfShowErr</A>
  <DD>
    The mf program generates a fair amount of verbiage even when it is working
    correctly. And if it is working correctly you don't want to see those words.
    So normally FontForge suppresses messages from mf. But if something goes
    wrong you do want to see mf's output and setting this will allow you to do
    so.<BR Clear=all>

<IMG SRC="prefs-script.png" WIDTH="282" HEIGHT="372" ALIGN="Right"><A NAME="scripts">This
section </A>of the dialog allows you to define built in scripts that will
show up in the <A HREF="filemenu.html#ScriptMenu">script menu</A>. Each entry
has two things associated with it, the menu name and a script file. The menu
name will be the name of this entry inside the script menu, and the
<A HREF="scripting.html">script file</A> will be the filename of the file
to be invoked. The "..." button allows you to browse for script files, which
I think have extension .pe (but which can have whatever extension you prefer
if you don't like my conventions).<BR Clear=All>
<P>
<IMG SRC="prefs-macfeat.png" WIDTH="282" HEIGHT="372" ALIGN="Right">The
<A NAME="Mac">Mac</A> Features dialog allows you to define a set of default
names (in many languages) for mac features and settings. These names are
placed in the 'name' table whenever a feature/setting is used in a generated
'morx' table. (Thus if you have some common ligatures in your font, then
the "ligature" feature names, and the "common ligature" setting names will
be added to the 'name' table).
<P>
You may also use this dialog to establish which setting(s) should be on by
default in a given feature and whether the feature only allows one setting
to be on at a time (the settings are mutually exclusive). All of this data
may be overridden by the similar dialog in the
<A HREF="fontinfo.html#Mac-Features">Element-&gt;Font Info </A>dialog.

    ALIGN="Left">To edit an existing feature double click on that feature in
the list (at right) this will bring up the dialog on the left. Each feature
must be assigned a unique number. You should indicate whether it has mutually
exclusive features or not. You should provide names for the feature in various
languages, and you should provide settings for the feature.
<P>
To add a new name press the [New] button under the name list and you will
be prompted for a language and a name.
<P>
To add a new setting press the [New] button under the setting list. The setting
dialog contains the numeric value of this setting (Apple has decreed that
if the feature is not mutually exclusive, all settings must be even numbers),
whether this setting is on by default, and then a list of names for the setting
in as many languages as you like.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
