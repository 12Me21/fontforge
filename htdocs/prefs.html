<DL>
  <DT>
    AutoWidthSync
  <DD>
    Whether you want the widths of accented characters to track the width of
    the base character (so if you modify the width of A then the width of &Agrave;
    will automagically change, if &Agrave; is built as a reference to A and a
    reference to grave)
  <DT>
    AutoLBearingSync
  <DD>
    Whether you want left side bearings of accented characters to track the left
    side bearing of base characters (so if you shift A left, then the accent
    in &Agrave; will also be shifted left)
  <DT>
    AutoHint
  <DD>
    Whether characters should be automagically hinted before a bitmap character
    is generated (improves the quality of the bitmap)
  <DT>
    LocalEncoding
  <DD>
    The default encoding used by the operating system (ie. text that is pasted
    into pfaedit will be assumed to be in this encoding). If you select "Default"
    here, pfaedit will attempt to guess the correct encoding by looking at:
    LC_MESSAGES, LC_ALL, LANG environment variables.
  <DT>
    NewCharset
  <DD>
    The default encoding used to create new fonts. Normally this is ISO 8859-1.
  <DT>
    ItalicConstrained
  <DD>
    Whether constrained motion in the character view should allow motion parallel
    to the italic angle as well as horizontal and vertical.
  <DT>
    AccentOffsetPercent
  <DD>
    The amount of space (as a percentage of the em-square) that should be placed
    between an accent and the character below it by the Build Accented Character
    command.
  <DT>
    AccentCenterBottom
  <DD>
    Whether accents should be positioned over letters based on the center of
    the accent, or on the center of the bottom of the accent.
  <DT>
    GreekFixup
  <DD>
    Whether to accept Adobe's naming conventions for greek letters, or to make
    them a bit more expected.
  <DT>
    ArrowMoveSize
  <DD>
    The number of em-units an arrow key will move a selected point in the character
    view.
  <DT>
    SnapDistance
  <DD>
    The maximum distance at which pointer motion in the character view will be
    snapped to an interesting object (ie. a point, baseline, width line,
    etc.)<BR Clear=all>

<DL>
  <DT>
    Foundry Name
  <DD>
    Used in generating bdf files (part of the X Windows font naming convention).
  <DT>
    TTFFoundry
  <DD>
    Similar to the above except that it is used inside ttf files (the achVendID
    field of the OS/2 table) and is limitted to 4 characters.
  <DT>
    XUID-Base
  <DD>
    The base
    "<A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/type/uniqueid.html">XUID</A>".
    Should uniquely identify the user's organization. If present then every new
    font will be given an XUID generated by appending a random number to the
    end of this string (which should consist of a set of numbers separated by
    spaces). Whenever a postscript font is generated then this last number will
    be incremented by 1.
  <DT>
    AskBDFResolution
  <DD>
    Normally PfaEdit will guess at what screen resolution you intend based on
    the pixel size of the font (ie. 17 pixel fonts are usually 100dpi (12pt)
    and 12 pixel fonts are usually 75dpi), but sometimes you will have more esoteric
    desires. Setting this will give you more control, but you have to click through
    another dlg.
  <DT>
    DumpGlyphMap
  <DD>
    Sometimes it is useful to have a mapping from ttf (or otf) glyph ID to character
    name. If you turn this on, then each time you generate a ttf/otf font you
    will also get a file with extension .g2n containing this mapping.
  <DT>
    PreferCJKEncoding
  <DD>
    This controls the loading of truetype and opentype fonts.
    If a font contains both an unicode encoding subtable and a cjk subtable, then
    this item allows you to pick which one PfaEdit will choose to decode.<BR Clear=ALL>
</DL>
<DL>
  <DT>
    <IMG SRC="prefs-apps.png" WIDTH="369" HEIGHT="494" ALIGN="Right">AutotraceArgs
  <DD>
    This allows you to specify any arguments you want passed to the autotrace
    program. Don't try to pass something that will change the input or output
    format or set input or output files.
  <DT>
    AutotraceAsk
  <DD>
    If this is set then each time autotrace is invoked it will ask you for arguments.
  <DT>
    MfArgs
  <DD>
    This is the command passed to the mf (MetaFont) program which controls conversion
    of .mf files into bitmaps.
  <DT>
    MfClearBg
  <DD>
    Loading a .mf font is a multi step process, first a bitmap font is generated,
    it is loaded into the background, then autotrace is invoked to trace around
    the backgrounds. These background bitmaps can take up a lot of space and
    you may not want them after they have been autotraced. Selecting this entry
    will remove those bitmaps from the font after they have been used.
  <DT>
    MfShowErr
  <DD>
    The mf program generates a fair amount of verbiage even when it is working
    correctly. And if it is working correctly you don't want to see those words.
    So normally PfaEdit suppresses messages from mf. But if something goes wrong
    you do want to see mf's output and setting this will allow you to do
    so.<BR Clear=all>

<IMG SRC="prefs-script.png" WIDTH="369" HEIGHT="494" ALIGN="Right"><A NAME="scripts">This
section </A>of the dialog allows you to define built in scripts that will
show up in the <A HREF="filemenu.html#ScriptMenu">script menu</A>. Each entry
has two things associated with it, the menu name and a script file. The menu
name will be the name of this entry inside the script menu, and the
<A HREF="scripting.html">script file</A> will be the filename of the file
to be invoked. The "..." button allows you to browse for script files, which
I think have extension .pe (but which can have whatever extension you prefer
if you don't like my conventions).<BR Clear=All>
A number of things that might be controlled from a preference window are
controlled by <A HREF="xres.html">X Resources</A>.
