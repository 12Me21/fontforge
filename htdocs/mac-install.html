<P>
You must insure that you have the the X11 server installed on your system.
This process is slightly different on OS/X 10.3 &amp; 10.4

    <UL>
      <LI>
	I believe the X server is now part of the default install. It lives in the
	Utilities sub-folder of the Applications directory.
    </UL>
  <DT>
    10.3
  <DT>
    <UL>
      <LI>
	The X server lives in a package called X11User on the third install CD.
    </UL>
</DL>
<P>
You may also want to install the
<A HREF="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">fink</A> package which includes many
useful libraries (see the
<A HREF="source-build.html#Dependencies">dependencies</A> section below for
more info on this)

I post a mac install package on
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=103338&amp;package_id=111040">sourceforge's
file release system</A>. There's a certain amount of pother involved in using
the file release system, but you get the file eventually.
<UL>
  <LI>
    If you follow the
    <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=103338&amp;package_id=111040">link
    above </A>you will end up on a page showing many releases of FontForge for
    many systems<BR>
    in most cases you will want the most recent release.
  <LI>
    Then click on the executable package you want to download:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	The mac release will be called something like "FontForge-200xxxxx.pkg.sitx
    </UL>
  <LI>
    Then you have the joy of choosing a mirror site (pick one that's on the same
    continent you are) and click on the little icon in the download column
  <LI>
    Then you wait. After a bit you get another copy of this same page. After
    an even longer time your browser notices that you've started a download.
</UL>
<H3>
  <A NAME="install">Installing</A>
</H3>
<P>
Generally your browser will decompress the package after pulling it down,
and then start the install process itself.
<P>
If this doesn't happen, find the package (it's usually on the desktop) and
double-click on it.
<P>
The install will request your password (to make sure you have the right to
do an install on your machine, and then ask some innocuous questions, and
proceed to install.

  <A NAME="Notes">Notes</A>
</H3>
<P>
FontForge does not conform to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines. FontForge
never will. Don't expect it to look like a normal Mac Application. It doesn't.
<P>
Before you can start FontForge you must start the X11 server. You do this
by opening the Utilities sub-folder of the Applications folder and double
-clicking on X11. This will bring up a new menu bar, and under the Applications
menu you should find an entry for FontForge.
