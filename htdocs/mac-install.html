  You must insure that you have the the X11 server installed on your system.

	  Open the Install DVD that came with your system.
	<LI>
	  Scroll down to "Optional Installs" and open it.
	<LI>
	  Keep clicking <CODE>Continue</CODE> until you get to the pane "Custom Install
	  on "Macintosh HD""
	<LI>
	  Press the arrow beside "Applications so you get a list of them.
	<LI>
	  Select X11
	<LI>
	  Keep pressing <CODE>Continue</CODE>

	  (I am told that on some systems you also need to install X11user)

      <UL>
	<LI>
	  The X server lives in a package called X11User.pkg in the Packages folder
	  on the third install CD.
	<LI>
	  Just double click on this file and follow its instructions to install X11
      </UL>
  </DL>
  <P>
  You may also want to install the
  <A HREF="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">fink</A> package which includes many
  useful libraries (see the
  <A HREF="source-build.html#Dependencies">dependencies</A> section below for
  more info on this)
  <H3>
    <A NAME="Obtaining">Obtaining</A> one of my pre-built packages
  </H3>
  <P>
  I post a mac install package on
  <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=103338&amp;package_id=111040">sourceforge's
  file release system</A>. There's a certain amount of pother involved in using
  the file release system, but you get the file eventually.
  <UL>
    <LI>
      If you follow the
      <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=103338&amp;package_id=111040">link
      above </A>you will end up on a page showing many releases of FontForge for
      many systems<BR>
      in most cases you will want the most recent release.
    <LI>
      Then click on the executable package you want to download:
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  The mac release will be called something like "FontForge-200xxxxx.pkg.sitx
      </UL>
    <LI>
      Then you have the joy of choosing a mirror site (pick one that's on the same
      continent you are) and click on the little icon in the download column
    <LI>
      Then you wait. After a bit you get another copy of this same page. After
      an even longer time your browser notices that you've started a download.
  </UL>
  <H3>
    <A NAME="install">Installing</A>
  </H3>
  <P>
  Generally your browser will decompress the package after pulling it down,
  and then start the install process itself.
  <P>
  If this doesn't happen, find the package (it's usually on the desktop) and
  double-click on it.
  <P>
  The install will request your password (to make sure you have the right to
  do an install on your machine, and then ask some innocuous questions, and
  proceed to install.
  <H3>
    <A NAME="Notes">Notes</A>
  </H3>
  <P>
  FontForge does not conform to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines. FontForge
  never will. Don't expect it to look like a normal Mac Application. It doesn't.
  <P>
  Before you can start FontForge you must start the X11 server. You do this
  by opening the Utilities sub-folder of the Applications folder and
  double-clicking on X11. This will bring up a new menu bar, and under the
  Applications menu you should find an entry for FontForge.
