	  A character is a Platonic ideal reified into at least one

	  is reified into several different glyphs: "S", "s", "<I>s</I>", long-s, etc.

	  although the glyph for an integral sign might be the same as the long-s glyph,

	  <A NAME="em">em</A>
	<DD>
	  A linear unit equal to the point size of the font. In a 10 point font, the
	  em will be 10 points. An em-space is white-space that is as wide as the point
	  size. An em-dash is a horizontal bar that is as wide as the point size.
	  <P>
	  An em-square is a square one em to each side. In traditional typograph (when
	  each letter was cast in metal) the glyph had to be drawn within the em-square.
	<DT>
	  <A NAME="em-unit">em unit</A>
	<DD>
	  In a scalable font the "em" is subdivided into units. In a postscript font
	  there are usually 1000 units to the em. In a TrueType font there might be
	  512, 1024 or 2048 units to the em. In an Ikarus font there are 15,000 units.
	  PfaEdit uses these units as the basis of its coordinate system.

	<DD>
	  One half of an "<A HREF="#em">em</A>"
	<DT>
	  <A NAME="encoding">Encoding</A>
	<DD>
	  An encoding is a mapping from a set of bytes onto a
	  <A HREF="glossary.html#character-set">character set</A>. It is what determines
	  which byte sequence represents which character. The words "encoding" and
	  "character set" are often used synonymously. The specification for ASCII
	  specifies both a character set and an encoding. But CJK character sets often
	  have multiple encodings for the character set (end multiple character sets
	  for some encodings).
	  <P>
	  In more complicated cases it is possible to have multiple glyphs associated
	  with each character (as in arabic where most characters have at least 4 different
	  glyphs) and the client program must pick the appropriate glyph for the character
	  in the current context.
	<DT>
	  <A NAME="Even-Odd">Even-Odd </A>Fill rule
	<DD>
	  To determine if a pixel should be
	  <A HREF="editexample2.html#even-odd" TARGET="_top">filled using this rule</A>,
	  draw a line from the pixel to infinity (in any direction) then count the
	  number of times contours cross this line. If that number is odd then fill
	  the point, if it is even then do not fill the point. This method is used
	  by postscript rasterizers after level 2.0 of PostScript. See Also

	  A font contains much of the information needed to turn a sequence of bytes
	  into a set of pictures representing the characters specified by those bytes.

	  In traditional typesetting a font was a collection of little blocks of metal

	  <A NAME="glyph">Glyph</A>
	<DD>
	  A glyph is an image, often asociated with one or several
	  <A HREF="#character">characters</A>. So the glyph used to draw "f" is associated
	  with the character f, while the glyph for the "fi" ligature is associated
	  with both f and i. In simple latin fonts the association is often one to
	  one (there is exactly one glyph for each character), while in more complex
	  fonts or scripts there may be several glyphs per character (In renaissance
	  printing the letter "s" had two glyphs associated with it, one, the long-s,
	  was used initially and medially, the other, the short-s, was used only at
	  the end of words). And in the ligatures one glyph is associated with two
	  or more characters.
	  <P>
	  <A HREF="#font">Fonts</A> are collections of glyphs with some form of mapping
	  from character to glyph.
	<DT>
	  <A NAME="Grid-Fitting">Grid</A> Fitting
	<DD>
	  Before TrueType glyphs are rasterized they go through a process called
	  <A HREF="overview.html#TrueType">grid fitting</A> where a tiny program
	  (associated with each glyph) is run which moves the points on the glyph's
	  outlines around until they fit the pixel grid better.
	<DT>
	  <A NAME="gothic">Gothic</A>
	<DD>
	  The German monks at the time of Gutenburg used a black-letter writing style,
	  and he copied their handwriting in his typefaces for printing. Italian type
	  designers (after printing spread south) sneered at the style, prefering the
	  type designs left by the romans. As a term of contempt they used the word
	  gothic, the style of the goths who helped destroy the roman empire.

	  "point" in common usage before the advent of computers. The one in use in
	  the Anglo-Saxon printing world was the "pica point" with 72.27 points per
	  inch ( 2.85pt /mm ), while the one used in Europe was the didot point with
	  62 <SUP>2</SUP>/<SMALL>3</SMALL> points per 23.566mm ( 2.66pt/mm or 67.54pt/inch
	  ).
	  <P>
	  These two points were so arranged that text at a given point-size would have
	  approximately the same <A HREF="#cap-height">cap-height</A> in both systems,
	  the didot point would have extra white-space above the capitals to contain
	  the accents present in most non-English Latin based scripts.
	  <P>
	  This has the interesting side effect that a font designed for European usage
	  should have a smaller proportion of the vertical em given over to the text
	  body. I believe that computer fonts tend to ignore this, so presumably european
	  printers now set with more leading.
	  <P>
	  As far as I can tell, computers tend to work in pica points (but this may
	  be because I am in the US).

	<DD>
	  PostScript is a page-layout language used by many printers. The language
	  contains the specifications of several different font formats. The main manual
	  has a section describing how <A HREF="overview.html#PT">PostScript differs
	  from TrueType</A>.
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      Type 1 -- This is the old standard for PostScript fonts. Such a font generally
	      has the extension .pfb (or .pfa). A type 1 font is limitted to a one byte
	      encoding (ie. only 256 characters may be encoded).
	    <LI>
	      Type 2 -- This is the format used within <A HREF="#opentype">OpenType</A>
	      fonts. It is almost the same as Type 1, but has a few extensions and a more
	      compact format.
	    <LI>
	      Type 3 -- This format allows full postscript within the font, but it means
	      that no <A HREF="#hints">hints</A> are allowed, so these fonts will not look
	      as nice at small point-sizes. Also most rasterizers are incapable of dealing
	      with them. A type 0 font is limitted to a one byte encoding (ie. only 256
	      characters may be encoded).
	    <LI>
	      Type 0 -- This format is used for collecting many sub-fonts (of Type 1 or
	      Type 3) into one big font, and was used for CJK or Unicode fonts.
	    <LI>
	      Type 42 -- A <A HREF="#truetype">TrueType</A> font wrapped up in PostScript.
	      Sort of the opposite from OpenType.
	    <LI>
	      CID -- This format is used for CJK fonts with large numbers of glyphs.

	  Back two thousand years ago when the Romans were carving their letters on
	  stone monuments, they discovered that they could reduce the chance of the
	  stone cracking by adding fine lines at the terminations of the main stems
	  of a character.
	  <P>
	  These fine lines were called serifs, and came to have an esthetic appeal
	  of their own. Early type designers added them to their fonts for esthetic
	  rather than functional reasons.
	  <P>
	  At the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth, type-designers
	  started designing fonts without serifs. These were initialially called grotesques
	  because their form appeared so strange, they are now generally called sans-serif.
	  <P>
	  Other writing systems (Hebrew for one) have their own serifs. Hebrew serifs
	  are rather different from latin (cyrillic, greek) serifs and I don't know
	  their history. Hebrew serifs only occur at the top of a character

	  I would welcome examples from other scripts of serifed and sans-serifed
