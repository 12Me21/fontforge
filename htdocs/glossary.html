    The baseline is the horizontal line on which the (latin, greek, cyrillic)
    letters sit. The baseline will probably be in a different place for different
    scripts. In Indic scripts most letters descend below the baseline. In CJK
    scripts there is also a vertical baseline usually in the middle of the
    character.<BR>

  <DD>
    A linear unit equal to the point size of the font. In a 10 point font, the em will be 10 points. An em-space is white-space that is as wide as the point size. An em-dash is a horizontal bar that is as wide as the point size.
    <P>
    An em-square is a square one em to each side. In traditional typograph (when
    each letter was cast in metal) the glyph had to be drawn within the em-square.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="em-unit">em unit</A>
  <DD>
    In a scalable font the "em" is subdivided into units. In a postscript font
    there are usually 1000 units to the em. In a TrueType font there might be
    512, 1024 or 2048 units to the em. In an Ikarus font there are 15,000 units.
    PfaEdit uses these units as the basis of its coordinate system.

  <DD>
    An encoding is a mapping from a set of bytes onto a
    <A HREF="glossary.html#character-set">character set</A>. It is what determines
    which byte sequence represents which character. The words "encoding"
    and "character set" are often used synonymously. The specification for
    ASCII specifies both a character set and an encoding. But CJK character sets
    often have multiple encodings for the character set (end multiple character
    sets for some encodings).

    <P>
    A font contains much of the information needed to turn a sequence of bytes
    into a set of pictures representing the characters specified by those bytes.
    <P>
    In traditional typesetting a font was a collection of little blocks of metal
    each with a graven image of a letter on it. Traditionally there was a different
    font for each point-size.

  <DD>
    A glyph is an image, often asociated with one or several
    <A HREF="#character">characters</A>. So the glyph used to draw "f" is associated
    with the character f, while the glyph for the "fi" ligature is associated
    with both f and i. In simple latin fonts the association is often one to
    one (there is exactly one glyph for each character), while in more complex
    fonts or scripts there may be several glyphs per character (In renaissance
    printing the letter "s" had two glyphs associated with it, one, the long-s,
    was used initially and medially, the other, the short-s, was used only at
    the end of words). And in the ligatures one glyph is associated with two
    or more characters.
    <P>
    <A HREF="#font">Fonts</A> are collections of glyphs with some form of mapping from character
    to glyph.
  <DT><A NAME="gothic">Gothic</A>
  <DD>
    The German monks at the time of Gutenburg used a black-letter writing style,
    and he copied their handwriting in his typefaces for printing. Italian
    type designers (after printing spread south) sneered at the style, prefering
    the type designs left by the romans. As a term of contempt they used the word
    gothic, the style of the goths who helped destroy the roman empire.

    In order for the curved shape of the "O" to appear to be the same height
    as the flat top of the "I" it tends to "overshoot" the cap-height (or x-height,
    or undershoot the baseline) by about 3% of the cap-height (or x-height).
    For a triangular shape (such as "A") the overshoot is even greater, perhaps
    5%.<BR>
    These guidelines are based on the way the eye works and the optical illusions

  <DT>
    <A NAME="point">Point</A>
  <DD>
    A point is a unit of measurement. There were two different definitions for
    "point" in common usage before the advent of computers. The one in use in
    the Anglo-Saxon printing world was the "pica point" with 72.27 points per
    inch ( 2.85pt /mm ), while the one used in Europe was the didot point with
    62 <SUP>2</SUP>/<SMALL>3</SMALL> points per 23.566mm ( 2.66pt/mm or 67.54pt/inch
    ).
    <P>
    These two points were so arranged that text at a given point-size would have
    approximately the same <A HREF="#cap-height">cap-height</A> in both systems,
    the didot point would have extra white-space above the capitals to contain
    the accents present in most non-English Latin based scripts.
    <P>
    This has the interesting side effect that a font designed for European usage
    should have a smaller proportion of the vertical em given over to the text
    body. I believe that computer fonts tend to ignore this, so presumably european
    printers now set with more leading.
    <P>
    As far as I can tell, computers tend to work in pica points (but this may
    be because I am in the US).

    <A NAME="point-size">Point Size</A>

    In traditional typography a 10pt font was one where the block of metal

  <DT>
    PostScript
  <DD>
    PostScript is a page-layout language used by many printers. The language
    contains the specifications of several different font formats. The main manual has a section
    describing how <A HREF="overview.html#PT">PostScript differs from TrueType</A>.
    <UL>
    <LI>Type 1 -- This is the old standard for PostScript fonts. Such a font generally
    has the extension .pfb (or .pfa). A type 1 font is limitted to a one byte
    encoding (ie. only 256 characters may be encoded).
    <LI>Type 2 -- This is the format used within <A HREF="#opentype">OpenType</A>
    fonts. It is almost the same as Type 1, but has a few extensions and a more
    compact format.
    <LI>Type 3 -- This format allows full postscript within the font, but it
    means that no <A HREF="#hints">hints</A> are allowed, so these fonts will
    not look as nice at small point-sizes. Also most rasterizers are incapable
    of dealing with them. A type 0 font is limitted to a one byte
    encoding (ie. only 256 characters may be encoded).
    <LI>Type 0 -- This format is used for collecting many sub-fonts (of Type 1 or Type 3) into one
    big font, and was used for CJK or Unicode fonts.
    <LI>Type 42 -- A <A HREF="#truetype">TrueType</A> font wrapped up in PostScript.
    Sort of the opposite from OpenType.
    <LI>CID -- This format is used for CJK fonts with large numbers of glyphs.

    Back two thousand years ago when the Romans were carving their letters on
    stone monuments, they discovered that they could reduce the chance of the
    stone cracking by adding fine lines at the terminations of the main stems
    of a character.
    <P>
    These fine lines were called serifs, and came to have an esthetic appeal
    of their own. Early type designers added them to their fonts for esthetic
    rather than functional reasons.
    <P>
    At the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth, type-designers
    started designing fonts without serifs. These were initialially called
    grotesques because their form appeared so strange, they are now generally
    called sans-serif.
    <P>
    Other writing systems (Hebrew for one) have their own serifs.
    Hebrew serifs are rather different from latin (cyrillic, greek) serifs and
    I don't know their history. Hebrew serifs only occur at the top of a character

    examples from other scripts of serifed and sans-serifed characters.

  <DD>
    A syllabary is a phonetic writing system like an alphabet. Unlike an alphabet
    the sound-unit which is written is a syllable rather than a letter. In
    Japanese KataKana the sound "ka" is represented by one glyph. Syllabaries tend
    to be bigger than alphabets (KataKana requires about 60 different characters,
    while the Korean Hangul requires tens of thousands).
