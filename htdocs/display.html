<P>
<IMG SRC="DisplayFonts.png" WIDTH="562" HEIGHT="343" ALIGN="Right">This dialog
allows you to display text in any fonts you have loaded into PfaEdit and
see how they look on the screen and together.
<P>
The textarea should behave like any of PfaEdit's textarea's (except this
one is a lot slower to respond than others), it also allows you to select
any piece of text in it and change the font and pixel size.
<P>
You may also select how the font is rasterized. The first four choices (pfb,
ttf, httf, otf) will be rasterized by freetype, and the display is very similar
to that used by X (so this is an easy way of checking how your fonts will
look on the screen without going to the bother of installing them.). The
various options specify in what format the font is passed to freetype:
<UL>
  <LI>
    pfb -- PostScript Type 1 font
  <LI>
    ttf -- Unhinted truetype font
  <LI>
    httf -- Hinted truetype font
  <LI>
    otf -- OpenType (PostScript Type 2) font
</UL>
<P>
The "bitmap" option allows you to pick from any of the generated bitmap (or
greymap) fonts that have already been generated and reside in the database.
<P>
The "pfaedit" option will invoke PfaEdit's own rasterizer. PfaEdit's rasterizer
generates appallingly bad bitmaps.
<P>
You can choose whether you want the font to be antialiased or not.
<P>
And different bits of text can have different settings, so you can compare
them and decide which is least worse. Also you can compare two different
fonts and see how well they work together.
