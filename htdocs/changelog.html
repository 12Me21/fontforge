  <P>
  <UL>
    <LI>
      15-Jan-2006
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  The change to fold all COMMENTS into one bdf property broke the sfnt 'BDF
	  ' table routines.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      14-Jan-2006
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Change AddExtrema so that if an extremum is very close to an old point it
	  will add the extremum and then remove the old point.
	<LI>
	  Redid how bdf properties were handled
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      I had the definitions of some properties slightly wrong
	    <LI>
	      I was generating some obsolete properties
	    <LI>
	      When I generated CHARSET_ENCODING for iso8859 encodings I had an extraneous
	      "-" in the value.
	    <LI>
	      retain the properties when loading a bdf, pcf font
	    <LI>
	      Add a dialog which gives user control over bdf properties
	    <LI>
	      design a 'BDF ' table for SFNT files which can contain bdf properties and
	      make FontForge read and generate this table.
	  </UL>
	<LI>
	  Ted Packard points out that I output "big metrics" in sfnts inconsistently.
	  This patch should make them consistent and right.
	<LI>
	  Restore "compact" views to their old glory. Ie. they can now be uncompacted
	  (and uncompaction happens automagically when generating a font).
	<LI>
	  When reading a GenTags: line from an sfd file stored with CRLF line terminators,
	  the next line would be lost.
	<LI>
	  ff couldn't handle xrefs which were broken in bits in pdf files?
	<LI>
	  When reading a ttf font from a pdf file we found no encoding info. This caused
	  us to crash because various routines expected an encoding map. Add a dummy
	  (Original) map if not exists.
	<LI>
	  Wasn't numbering points in references properly.
	<LI>
	  Gleep! Ever since the gettext code went in, the Generate fonts dlg has refused
	  to generate "No Outline Font" and "No Bitmap Font".
	<LI>
	  Herbert Duerr from OpenOffice tells me that their OpenSymbol.ttf font when
	  produced by fontforge does not work on Win98. This is because Win98 doesn't
	  like the codepages bits ff produces and refuses to use any glyphs in the
	  font. He submitted a patch to make ff produce a version 0 OS/2 table (with
	  no codepage info) for this font. Win98 will accept it then. His patch was
	  against an earlier version of ff and needed to be modified for the current
	  version.
	<LI>
	  Patch by Raph Levien which finally shows me how to use FT_Outline_Get_Bitmap
	  properly.
	<LI>
	  If the user has never called PrintSetup (or if the user has not called PrintSetup
	  this session and has not loaded prefs), then fontforge will invode setpagedevice
	  on a pagesize which will fit on either A4 or US-Letter. The PS manual says
	  a printer should refuse such a size unless it has paper within 5 points of
	  it. So on printers which follow the spec (not mine) nothing will print as
	  it waits for paper.
	  <P>
	  Now if the pagesize has not been set, don't specify a PageSize to setpagedevice.
	<LI>
	  The PrintSetup scripting command should not require a font.
	<LI>
	  Add a mechanism so that users can prevent ff from making a point implicit.
	  Useful in that point needs to be instructed.
	<LI>
	  New copyright notices for 2006
	<LI>
	  Make the pen tool work better with quadratic splines (make it default to
	  having control points which cause the point to be implicit).
	<LI>
	  Order2 elipses were not drawn accurately.
	<LI>
	  Point numbers sometimes didn't get properly renumbered after changes. If
	  we have references &amp; splines in a (truetype) glyph then show the numbers
	  as "?".
	<LI>
	  When a charview displays numbered (truetype) points, then it shows all the
	  control points. But the control points are not selectable. This is not a
	  good thing, so make them selectable.
	<LI>
	  The font display to pdf did not include a title at the top of each page.
	<LI>
	  Peter Denisevich points out that when we print something we say "%%Pages
	  atend" instead of "%%Pages (atend)". And the latter is correct.
	<LI>
	  Werner points out that my type1 (and type1 cid) fonts contain a
	  %%DocumentSuppliedResource line, and they should not. The next level up should
	  do that when it includes the font.
	<LI>
	  Show .xpm files as images we support in import image dlg. We've always supported
	  them, might as well show them.
	<LI>
	  Check the glyph class when deciding what anchor to use.
	<LI>
	  Anshuman Pandey wants to be able to set the glyph's GDEF class. I've never
	  understood why the default behavior wasn't good enough, but it's easy to
	  do.
	<LI>
	  One of the fields in Glyph Info had some garbage initialization.
	<LI>
	  Add a default anchor point type to the AddAnchorPoint scripting command.
	  FF will try to guess an appropriate value.
	<LI>
	  Add some standard window sizes to the fontview window. I'm tired of having
	  the windows sized to other people's standards whenever I review a bug.
	<LI>
	  There was a path through expand stroke where a control point was marked as
	  non-e xistant by mistake.
	<LI>
	  Expand Stroke would leave contours with the reversed orientation if it had
	  to do a remove overlap internally.
	<LI>
	  Oops. The routine to save the encoding prefs file could not handle an encoding
	  plug-in.
	<LI>
	  KANOU points out that the origin pulldown list in the transform dlg was not
	  being translated.
	<LI>
	  In the preference dlg all of the [...] file browsers had the title "Call
	  Script" which isn't appropriate for most of them.
	<LI>
	  Typing .* and pressing [Filter] did not show hidden files in the file chooser.
	<LI>
	  the code to check for intersections failed to check if there were a crossover
	  in the last tiny section of a spline before its end.
	<LI>
	  Was generating ofm files when creating bdf fonts. Seems unnecessary.
	<LI>
	  Was producing a EBLC table with bad first/last values for first glyphs.
	<LI>
	  Hmm. Not all systems have tzset. Add a configuration option for it.
	<LI>
	  In scripting, a return within a loop sent ff into an infinite loop.
	<LI>
	  Kanou's patch for adding a new flag to scripting Import, to clear out the
	  layer first.
	<LI>
	  Patch from KANOU to add SetGlyphChanged scripting function.
	<LI>
	  If an implied point became real, this fact was not reflected on the display
	  until the user forced a point renumbering.
	<LI>
	  A mouse click in an empty metrics view references garbage memory -- And crashed
	  Kanou's session.
	<LI>
	  Loading a large bitmap font left bits of the backmap of the encoding map
	  uninitialized.
	<LI>
	  Loading a pcf font caused a crash.
	<LI>
	  Moving the control points of an implied point should move the implied point.
	  And we should indicate which points are implied so this behavior doesn't
	  surprise.
	<LI>
	  Michal Nowakowski points out that renumbering points in a glyph should turn
	  off point matching in references.
	<LI>
	  Add support for bitmaps with vertical metrics.
	<LI>
	  Wasn't storing the vendor id in the OS/2 table properly.
	<LI>
	  Rounding error present on PPC which was absent on *86 machines.
	<LI>
	  Werner would like pixel size info to show on the title of a charview when
	  debugging.
	<LI>
	  Added a new menu command "Point-&gt;Center Between Control Points" for truetype.
	<LI>
	  When manipulating menus with keys (rather than mouse) Werner found a crash.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      5-Dec-2005
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Creating the first bitmap view might cause a crash -- depending on how the
	  linker organized memory.
	<LI>
	  Loading an sfd file now checks to see if there are any glyphs with splines
	  in them, and if there are not turns on the onlybitmaps flag. Someone pointed
	  out that if you inadvertantly edit in the outline view -- even if it is nothing
	  significant, then the font is forever after marked as outline. This isn't
	  a perfect fix, but it will prevent the worst from happening.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      1-Dec-2005
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Use GNU gettext rather than my nomen routines to handle translation of the
	  UI..
	<LI>
	  Add support for plugins.
	<LI>
	  I added a check in parsing tfm files to make sure I didn't read outside the
	  bounds of the kern table. But the table size was expressed in ints (32 bit
	  units), and my index was in bytes, so I frequently exceded it.
	<LI>
	  If we used Get Info on a reference in a ttf font, and that reference did
	  NOT do point matching we would generate an inappropriate error.
	<LI>
	  My support for using endchar as seac in type2 fonts only worked in bare cff
	  fonts, it did not work if the cff were inside an sfnt wrapper (opentype).
	<LI>
	  I have decided that I will now store all postscript strings in utf8 (copyright,
	  weight, familyname, etc.) They SHOULD all be ascii. But the occasional copyright
	  mark would sneak in. We went into an infinite loop on one such because that
	  was an illegal utf8 string. So fix a number of problems related to this.
	<LI>
	  Switch from using an internal routine to using freetype to rasterize b&amp;w
	  bitmaps when debugging ttf instructions.
	<LI>
	  Make the gridfit/debug settings sticky across invocations (store in prefs).
	<LI>
	  Add popup info showing the level of greyness in a truetype font being debugged
	  in anti-alias mode.
	<LI>
	  Werner suggests altering the dynamic range of anti-aliased rasters in the
	  charview so that the outlines remain visible behind them.
	<LI>
	  Make the background color of the debugger raster window configurable by the
	  user
	<LI>
	  If a curved point had no control point in one direction, then ff thought
	  it had no direction and felt free to change it. It should inherit the direction
	  from the other side of the point. This was even more confusing if the point
	  went through a two step process, first simplifying one side into a line (losing
	  the cp) then simplifying the line away (losing the direction).
	<LI>
	  Use a better algorithm to indicate changed pixels. (in debug window)
	<LI>
	  Screwed up View-&gt;Show Grid Fit... in Mono mode.
	<LI>
	  Werner wants to be able to see grey scale rasters while debugging truetype.
	  He also points out that if the instruction before the end of instructions
	  changes pixels, ff would leave them marked "changed" even after finishing
	  the instructions.
	<LI>
	  We were getting multiple error windows.
	<LI>
	  Don't allow users to add instructions to a glyph containing both a reference
	  and contours. Or a glyph where a reference is scaled more than 200%. (tt
	  doesn't allow these combinations so the references need to be copied inline)
	<LI>
	  Typo in remove overlap caused bad bug in feta26. Error introduced 15 Sept.
	<LI>
	  Further work on what makes a spline linear.
	<LI>
	  The utf7 output routine in sfd did not convert from utf8 properly.
	<LI>
	  Panov has found yet another error in simplify. Be really exuberant about
	  turning splines that trace out lines into lines.
	<LI>
	  Panov finds another bug:
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      If we change the unicode value of a glyph, then we also need to change
	    <LI>
	      the unicode value of any references to that glyph.
	  </UL>
	<LI>
	  Panov presents four more bugs:
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      If an sfd file contains an unencoded glyph, it will crash
	    <LI>
	      Force Encoding-&gt;Original will crash if there's a bdf font missing some
	      characters (ie. the piecemeal display font)
	    <LI>
	      Goto Dlg tried to free an uninit value
	    <LI>
	      Goto Dlg contained a string initialized by latin1 rather than utf8.
	  </UL>
	<LI>
	  Hmm. the changedsincelasthinted flag doesn't apply to truetype. The equivalent
	  thing (I guess) is not having any instructions on a glyph with splines.
	<LI>
	  Panov wants a way to build up arrays using easier syntax than: create array,
	  assign each element.
	<LI>
	  Sometimes we would get both an EUC-CN and a GB2312packed entry in the Encoding
	  menu.
	<LI>
	  Create a plugin for GB12345, and treat it (in sfnt tables) as GB2312.
	<LI>
	  Add a new scripting funtion: NearlyLines to convert almost linear splines
	  to linear.
	<LI>
	  Tweak AddExtrema so that it doesn't create Extrema points which are too close
	  to the endpoints.
	<LI>
	  Didn't terminate an array of answer strings to a question dialog.
	<LI>
	  Fixed a crash in stem database.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      28-Oct-2005
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  More work on the mac install procdure.
	<LI>
	  Redo the install documentation on the website &amp; in the readmes
	<LI>
	  Add a hack to the directory browser so that on cygwin getting a directory
	  listing of "/" will include the magic (fake) directory /cygdrive (which gives
	  access to the rest of the PC)
	<LI>
	  Add a new scripting funtion: NearlyLines to convert almost linear splines
	  to linear.
	<LI>
	  Tweak AddExtrema so that it doesn't create Extrema points which are too close
	  to the endpoints.
	<LI>
	  I was dumping all opentype ligatures into an ofm(tfm) file. But I should
	  probably only add 'liga' and 'rlig' ligatures.
	<LI>
	  Omega has a bug where it thinks 0 width glyphs do not exist. Which means
	  it thinks none of the combining accents, etc. exist. So force the width of
	  any zero width glyphs to be the smallest positive width.
	<LI>
	  When reading ttf/otf fonts, FF gave alternate substitutions (and multiple
	  subs?) a tag of 0.
	<LI>
	  Add two scripting routines to allow people to read &amp; write strings from
	  and to files. One string per file.
	<LI>
	  The ClearTable scripting command parsed the table's tag incorrectly.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      23-Oct-2005
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Try to make the Mac install a bit more mac-like by adding an entry to the
	  X11 Applications menu rather than expecting users to start fontforge from
	  the command line.
	<LI>
	  David Binderman points out an out of bounds array reference in cvexport which
	  has been there for years. Gleep.
	<LI>
	  Add scripting commands for manipulating ttf instructions.
	  <P>
	  I added the following new scripting functions:
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SetMaxpValue("item-name",
	      value)
	    <LI>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GetMaxpValue("item-name")
	    <LI>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ClearInstrs()
	    <LI>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ClearTable(tag)
	    <LI>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AddInstrs(thingamy,replace,instrs)
	    <LI>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FindOrAddCvtIndex(value[,sign-matters])
	    <LI>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ReplaceCvtAt(index,value)
	    <LI>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GetCvtAt(index)
	    <LI>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PrivateToCvt()
	  </UL>
	<LI>
	  Daniel Gillmor points out there is no way to set the OS/2 Width field from
	  a script. He then provided a patch with two new functions which does this.
	  I realize there is no way to set any of the OS/2 values (except panose),
	  and there should be (and to retrieve them too).
	  <P>
	  I added the following new scripting functions:
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SetOS2Value("item-name",
	      value)
	    <LI>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GetOS2Value("item-name")
	    <LI>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SetPrivateValue("item-key","item-value")
	    <LI>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GetPrivateValue("item-key")
	    <LI>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HasPrivateValue("item-key")
	    <LI>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RemovePrivateValue("item-key")
	  </UL>
	<LI>
	  A number of fixes for ofm files.
	<LI>
	  When outputting mark-to-base lookups with multiple anchor classes, ff would
	  put a base glyph in the coverage table several times if it was used by several
	  mark classes. Bad.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      18-Oct-2005
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  KANOU points out that I was using too strict a rule for parsing svg polygons.
	<LI>
	  OFM output was not working in fonts with lots of kerning combinations.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      16-Oct-2005
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  A number of fixes for ofm files.
	<LI>
	  Add default 'nukt' "ligature" substitutions to appropriate Devanagari characters
      </UL>
    <LI>
      15-Oct-2005
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  The patch to the routine determining what glyphs got output broke bitmap
	  only fonts.
	<LI>
	  Ofm files didn't contain ligatures.
	<LI>
	  The ofm patch broke tfm output.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      12-Oct-2005
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Add support for generating &amp; parsing ofm files (I hope)
	<LI>
	  If I tried to generate a font from an absolutely empty fontdb (ie. a new
	  one) then I'd get a stupid error about how .notdef was at encoding -1 and
	  this was a bad idea.
	<LI>
	  Add 4 new information types to scripting GlyphInfo
	  <DL>
	    <DT>
	      * LayerCount
	    <DD>
	      Number of layers in glyph (usually 2)
	    <DT>
	      * RefCount
	    <DD>
	      Number of refs in glyph
	    <DT>
	      * RefNames
	    <DD>
	      Returns an array of all reference names (may be 0 length)
	    <DT>
	      * RefTransform
	    <DD>
	      Returns an array of all reference transforms
	  </DL>
	<LI>
	  Don't mark glyphs with widths other than 1em as being worth outputting (require
	  widthset). Used to use both (because in the early days, before pfaedit moved
	  to sourceforge even, the widthset bit didn't exist). Now there are too many
	  cases w here glyphs are created with a width other than 1em (marks, glyphs
	  in monospace fonts (where the space is anything but 1em)).
	<LI>
	  When printing a type3 pdf font, give it a name. Not required, but so what.
	<LI>
	  Patch from Michal Nowakowski. When editing truetype instructions using my
	  prefix notation for numbers, there was a crash if a number needed a word
	  (rather than a byte).
	<LI>
	  Add some support for reading fonts out of a pdf file.
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      Limitted support for pdf type3 (no images)
	    <LI>
	      Only support (Hex, 85, Flate, RLE)Decode filters (no support for lzw, fax,
	      JBIG, DCT)
	  </UL>
	<LI>
	  The routine to build the stem database (autohint) would set up a point database
	  and then call a routine to convert all splines into a set of monotonics.
	  But that routine could remove 0 length splines (and the points attached),
	  which would mean our point db would be wrong.
	<LI>
	  Stefan Wanger suggests some patches to fix memory leaks.
	<LI>
	  Stefan Wanger gave me a type2 font which used type1 flex conventions (calling
	  othersubrs, etc.) There is no othersubrs operator in type2, nor any place
	  to store othersubrs subroutines. But it is easy enough to support, so why
	  not. Warn that it's an illegal font, of course.
	<LI>
	  Stefan Wanger gave me a font containing the utf8 byte order mark in a fontname
	  ( in a CFF Name Index). PostScript says FontNames are printable ASCII. But
	  it's easy enough to skip over it.
	<LI>
	  Stepan Roh points out that in a monospace font, combining glyphs should default
	  to the mono-width while in a proportional font they should default to 0 width
	  (or perhaps 1 em-unit for compatability with old idiotic windows systems).
	  Use the panose field to determine if a font is monospace.
	  <P>
	  Actually ALL glyphs in a monospace font should default to the mono-space
	  width rather than 1em.
	<LI>
	  New dialog: Hints-&gt;Edit 'maxp'... Gives user access to number of functions
	  defined, the stack depth, storage usage, number of twilight points, which
	  ff can't figure out for you.
	<LI>
	  Figured out how to make transparent images work on cygwin
	<LI>
	  Michal Nowakowski points out that negative values are duplicated in cvt.
	<LI>
	  Patch from Michal Nowakowski fixing crash when setting size of cvt table
	  to 0.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      29-Sept-2005
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Add utf8 entry points for many (ucs2) routines. Minimal ability to draw non-BMP
	  glyphs now with <A HREF="nonBMP/index.html">bdf fonts</A> with encodings:
	  *-UnicodePlane-1 (for plane 1), *-UnicodePlane-2 (for plane 2), etc.
	<LI>
	  Add a menu command to add values from the private dict into the cvt table
	  (BlueValues, StemSnaps).
	<LI>
	  The Edit cvt window usually failed to draw anything in itself when it popped
	  up (subsequent refreshes were ok).
	<LI>
	  Patch from Michal Nowakowski to improve memory usage in auto instr.
	<LI>
	  Printing sample text was broken in fonts with no kerning classes.
	<LI>
	  cygwin does very weird things with shared libaries, and we didn't support
	  them at all.
	<LI>
	  FontForge did not support the depreciated usage of endchar to mean (almost)
	  seac in type2 charstrings. It should now.
	<LI>
	  os2 typo linegap was not read out of sfd files.
	<LI>
	  Display 'gai' files in the open dlg.
	<LI>
	  I got some mnemonics wrong. Fix 'em up.
	<LI>
	  bdftopcf will use the glyph encoded at 0 as the default glyph if there is
	  no explicit DEFAULT_CHAR. It seems happy with a DEFAULT_CHAR of -1 to mean
	  no default, so use that if we don't want glyph 0 to be the default.
	<LI>
	  when outputting bdf, fnt or pt3 bitmap fonts with no outline font generated,
	  we'd get filenames like foo-*-13.bdf. Get rid of the "-*".
	<LI>
	  Support point numbering of composites even when not debugging.
	<LI>
	  Michal Nowakowski points out that the cvt editor crashed if we changed the
	  length of the table.
	<LI>
	  Provide two new scripting functions:
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      MoveReference(xoff,yoff,[ref-name/ref-unicode]+)
	    <LI>
	      PositionReference(x,y,[ref-name/ref-unicode]+)
	  </UL>
	  <P>
	  These search all selected glyphs, looking for any references in those glyphs
	  with the given name/unicode value, and then translating the reference by
	  (xoff,yoff) or positioning the reference absolutely at (x,y).
	<LI>
	  ff failed to read horizontal metrics properly from a type2 CFF CID font.
	  In most cases this would be masked by the fact that ff would correct the
	  bad width values by reading the hmtx table. But if one had a bare CFF font,
	  or a 'gai' font where there is no external source of widths, ff would get
	  things wrong.
	<LI>
	  Alexej Kryukov points out that most entries in the private dict should be
	  scaled when we do a ScaleToEm.
	<LI>
	  Fix a couple of problems with cid font display that "gai" fonts expose.
	<LI>
	  Michal Nowakowski points out that I generated truetype instructions --- and
	  then forgot to attach them to the glyph. Whoops.
	<LI>
	  Loading extensible glyph information from a tfm file was broken by the encoding
	  change.
      </UL>
    <LI>

      <UL>
	<LI>
	  ff did not read AAT classes (kerning classes, etc) properly. It read one
	  extra element which could cause problems
	<LI>
	  Cleanup svg output for kerning classes with no members.
	<LI>
	  Out of bounds array reference in OS2FigureCodePages caused a crash on the
	  mac.
	<LI>
	  When loading a type1 font we failed to set the unicode encoding on seac
	  references. This probably broke lots of things, it certainly broke replace
	  with reference.
	<LI>
	  Add a DefaultRoundToGrid scripting function to set the Round-to-Grid truetype
	  reference bit (basically set it whenever we have a reference which isn't
	  point matched).
	<LI>
	  Add support for truetype point matching in references and anchor points
	<LI>
	  Improve the debugging heuristic that notices when we've jumpped to a new
	  routine to work better with composites
	<LI>
	  If I attempted to debug a glyph with no instructions there was a race condition
	  and if the race was won one way, ff would hang.
	<LI>
	  We weren't numbering points in a composite. This was only obvious when we
	  did a View-&gt;Show Grid Fit on a composite glyph.
	<LI>
	  When debugging a composite glyph, ff forgot that some references are translated
	  (or scaled or rotated), and failed to display this.
	<LI>
	  FF failed to keep track of the truetype "RoundToGrid" bit which applies to
	  references.
	<LI>
	  In the Points window of truetype debugging, if the penultimate point of a
	  contour was interpolated, then the contour boundary was drawn in the wrong
	  place.
	<LI>
	  Use to store debugging dpi/pointsize in the charview. Werner suggests that
	  it be global (so different glyphs will all share the same defaults).
	<LI>
	  Some Unicode code blocks have moved (probably those which only in the pipeline
	  or some such), and some others have been added to the pipeline.

      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Can't use a subroutine to refer to a translated glyph which contains flex
	  hints in type1 output.
	<LI>
	  Hide another problem with rounding errors in remove overlap.
	<LI>
	  Don't produce multiple warnings about the local encoding.
	<LI>
	  In quadratic fonts the Remove Overlap menu item is disabled, but if you use
	  the hotkey the command is invoked (with disasterous results).
	<LI>
	  Typo in point info code to determine whether a hint mask contains conflicts
	  (matched vertical hints against horizontal ones)
      </UL>
    <LI>
      12-Sept-2005
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Added a scripting command DefaultUseMyMetrics() to set the use_my_metrics
	  bit in old fonts.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      11-Sept-2005
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  &nbsp;&nbsp; When ff pastes refs from one font to another it tries to figure
	  out the width of a glyph containing references from the width of what appears
	  to be the base glyph. (because if you paste Aacute from one font to another,
	  the size of the "A" glyph may be quite different in the new font. Using the
	  width of the glyph in the original font would be wrong).
	  <P>
	  There are two problems with this:
	  <OL>
	    <LI>
	      It didn't take forward references into account, and would use the original
	      width rather than the modified width of the reference.
	    <LI>
	      It would (probably) be confused by an Alphatonos where the width of Alphatonos
	      is not the same as that of Alpha.
	  </OL>
	  <P>
	  instead figure widths out after all pastes have completed, looking at the
	  use_my_metrics bit to get things right.
	<LI>
	  Handle forward references to glyphs which will be pasted into by the current
	  command (used to work, broken by the encoding change)
	<LI>
	  Various fixes for pasting references from a font which has since been closed.
	<LI>
	  Support the ttf "_USE_MY_METRICS" bit on composite glyphs. This entails:
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      Retaining it when reading a truetype font
	    <LI>
	      Setting properly when generating one
	    <LI>
	      Storing it in sfd files
	    <LI>
	      Giving the user a way to set it with the Element-&gt;GetInfo command

	  ff crashed when given a bdf font with multiple glyphs with the same name
	<LI>
	  Try to avoid generating bdf fonts with multiple glyphs with the same name.
	  This happened when a single glyph was mapped to several encodings, a concept
	  bdf doesn't support. Now when it looks like this will happen we rename the
	  glyph.
	<LI>
	  Uninitialized variable in dependant sub-menu (broken by encoding change)
	<LI>
	  Pasting a reference into a font which did not contain the referred glyph
	  did not give you the option of copying the original outlines any more. (broken
	  by the encoding change)
	<LI>
	  Merging fonts where glyphs had multiple encodings caused crashes.
	<LI>
	  I'm very old fashioned. I like having error messages on stderr. But far too
	  many people don't see them there. I guess they invoke fontforge directly
	  from X with stderr directed to some invisible console window. Well create
	  a little window to contain warning messages about font errors (for instance
	  when reading an otf font we might complain about glyphs out of bounds, etc.)
	<LI>
	  Add support for postscript bitmap fonts. This means:
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      Ability to parse (simple forms of) the imagemask ps operator
	    <LI>
	      Code to detect that a type3 is a ps bitmap, and convert it into a normal
	      bitmap font that people can edit.
	    <LI>
	      Bitmap output as a ps type3 font (using imagemask)
	    <LI>
	      Fixing a bug in my output routines which worked fine for images in eps files,
	      but failed horribly if that same code was stuffed into a charproc and executed
	      on demand.
	  </UL>
	<LI>
	<LI>
	  ff could not handle an encoding specified as a simple array. (Not allowed
	  in typ e1 spec, but obvious for a type3)
	<LI>
	  And ff's handling of any type3s was broken by the encoding patch.
	<LI>
	  If a font contained fewer than 256 glyphs, then ff failed to load a format0
	  cmap subtable properly.
      </UL>

	  In fontinfo, changed the tab "TTF Values" to be "OS/2", consolidated the
	  Panose tab underneath it. Added many more fields, almost all of OS/2.
	<LI>
	  Fixed a number of uninitialized variables, at the instigation of Pavel Roskin.
	<LI>
	  Applied several patches from Pavel Roskin.
	<LI>
	  The scripting WorthOutputting command insisted on an argument, even when
	  it should not have.
	<LI>
	  Scripting SetCharCnt command has been broken since the encoding change.
