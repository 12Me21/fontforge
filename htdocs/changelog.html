</H1>
<UL>
  <LI>
    28-Apr-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Yet more fixes for Remove overlap
      <LI>
	Added a mode to the ruler tool where it shows the exact position of the mouse
	cursor
      <LI>
	The Goto command had a strange bug: If a font had a glyph with a known name,
	but that glyph did not reside at the unicode slot assigned to that name,
	then goingto that name would go to the (empty) unicode slot, rather than
	to the actually character.
      <LI>
	Werner wants a <A HREF="showatt.html">dlg</A> which shows collects all the
	GPOS/GSUB (morx/kern) information in one place rather than scattering it
	around hundreds of dlgs.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit now stores the script/langs for kern pairs
      <LI>
	PfaEdit failed to read script/langs for GPOS properly.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit had problems generating an AFM file from a CID font with ligatures
      <LI>
	PfaEdit had problems getting script lang lists right when multiple features
	refered to the same lookup.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    20-Apr-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	One of PfaEdit's deficiencies is that it handles multiple encodings for the
	same glyph very badly (it does not have the multiple layers of indirection
	that fonts do). Rather than solve this properly I have added a new command
	that allows for this case.
	<A HREF="editmenu.html#SameGlyphAs">SameGlyphAs</A>.
      <LI>
	Add some more synonyms for greek glyph names
      <LI>
	Failed to realize that U+1FED was an accent
      <LI>
	No longer tries to build greek accents out of latin ones when Build Accented
	is invoked. (but still will for Build Composit).
      <LI>
	When swapping character names, check for names like "uniXXXX" and instead
	of swapping it, rebuild it as appropriate for the other character.
      <LI>
	Font Info-&gt;Encoding failed to change the encoding properly when switching
	from "Compacted" to anything other than the original encoding.
      <LI>
	A couple of changes to the italian translation
      <LI>
	Added an "Original" encoding which gives you back the ordering of the glyphs
	in the ttf font. (this may be changed when you regenerate a ttf font)
      <LI>
	PfaEdit failed to read ttf instructions for composit glyphs.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit got confused if a ttf file had multiple glyphs named ".notdef" (which
	to me looks like a bug in the ttf font, but Times New Roman does this so
	I have to deal with it).
      <LI>
	Added a command to the popup menu in the charview to bring up a window looking
	at a reference.
      <LI>
	Add a check for when sfd files contain bad kerning info.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    14-Apr-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Change a tab in Font Info from "PS General" to "General"
      <LI>
	When searching for encoding files, look for the extension ".enc" used by
	TeX for PostScript encoding files
      <LI>
	Fixed a crash when setting a character's name to a name already given to
	another character
      <LI>
	Added many new X resources for controlling colors in the outline character
	view.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    7-Apr-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Program generated divide by zero errors when using Meta-Shift to move a control
	point which didn't exist.
      <LI>
	(cleaned up some syntax issues in non-English nomen files)
      <LI>
	Added new scripting commands ClearPrivateEntry, ChangePrivateEntry,
	GetPrivateEntry
      <LI>
	Added new scripting command: UnicodeFromName
      <LI>
	Added new script command: RemoveATT
      <LI>
	Vadim pointed out that loading "pala.ttf" and then generating it again (as
	ttf) produced bad results. PfaEdit was getting confused by the points which
	were used to control Anchors, getting its points list out of order and generally
	screwing up.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    04-Apr-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	autosave sometimes lost track of which font it should be applying changes
	to.t
      <LI>
	Add Extrema (or just adding a point in the middle of a spline) would generate
	incorrect splines if the spline were linear in one but not both of the two
	dimensions
      <LI>
	One more change to Merge/Simplify. Deal with the case of a curve point with
	no control point (use the control point in the opposite direction to get
	the slope).
      <LI>
	Typo in 2-Apr script/lang fix caused crashes.
      <LI>
	TeXBaseEncoding (T1) changed in Oct-2002. Updated my version (also updated
	the other TeX encodings I've got and included the cyrillic ones into
	Encodings.ps.gz)
      <LI>
	Sometimes we failed to remove the dot when creating a dotless i/j character.
      <LI>
	Merge/Simplify had caniptions when given a zero length spline.
      <LI>
	Added "DefaultATT" and "AddATT" scripting command to allow user to add Advanced
	Typography features to characters.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    2-Apr-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Problems with script/lang when: Pasting or Merging ligatures and substitutions
	from one font to another
      <LI>
	PfaEdit could generate points (within a ttf simple glyph) in a different
	than the original glyph, meaning that the instructions would move the wrong
	point resulting in blots. I have fixed this (or at least the cases I found).
      <LI>
	PfaEdit would always give ASCII characters their standard names in a ttf
	post table. This was wrong if the character did not have its standard name.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit could go into an infinite loop on some simplifies.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    1-Apr-2003 (April Fish!)
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Fixed a crash in the Join command
      <LI>
	Fixed a crash when loading some truetype fonts (never bothered to figure
	which ones exactly)
      <LI>
	Fixed a similar crash when loading old sfd files (note some old fonts won't
	guess the script for ligatures, etc. properly)
      <LI>
	Added a new preference item: Stop At Join
      <LI>
	Changed the way control points are set when changing point type.
      <LI>
	The fill of the outline view sometimes lagged the change.
      <LI>
	Added another tag to CharInfo scripting command: GlyphIndex. It returns the
	glyph number in the ttf font.
      <LI>
	Werner suggests that instead of namint things "nounicode-%x" where %x is
	the encoding, use "nounicode-%d-%d-%x" where the two new arguments are the
	platform/specific pair used in the cmap we picked.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    31-Mar-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit was not reading pfb fonts properly if they had more than one binary
	section header.
      <LI>
	When PfaEdit removed a character it did not remove all the kernpairs that
	refered to that character.
      <LI>
	Fixed more leaks with valgrind.
      <LI>
	Added more synonyms for glyph names from Adobe Glyph List (I still rely on
	Glyph names for New Fonts as my basic set of names)
      <LI>
	PfaEdit had problems if the use selected 0 levels of undoes when the UI was
	active.
      <LI>
	Selecting the freehand tool in a quadratic font caused a crash. (The freehand
	tool doesn't work in quadratic fonts, but it shouldn't crash)
      <LI>
	Changed the way scripts are specified. I used to assign a script to every
	character. I realize that doesn't work. The digits are used in many scripts
	and the fraction ligatures based on them need to be seen in all those scripts,
	not just the one that the digit was assigned to. So...
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    Glyphs no longer have a script assigned to them
	  <LI>
	    Substitutions, Ligatures, Anchor Classes and other Advanced Typographic features
	    now have a list of scripts (and languages) for which they are active.
	  <LI>
	    There is now an absurdly complex <A HREF="charinfo.html#Feature-Tag">stream
	    of dialogs</A> which may be used to set this list.
	</UL>
      <LI>
	Added a new preference item to allow the user to specify a local help directory
      <LI>
	Added a new scripting command SelectIf which allows you to determine whether
	a character is in a font (Select signals an error if the character isn't
	there, SelectIf returns failure).
      <LI>
	Added a new scripting command to change a font's order (from quadratic to
	cubic)
      <LI>
	ScaleToEm scripting command will now accept a single argument, the em-size.
      <LI>
	Added a new scripting command to allow you to apply an otf substitution to
	the font
      <LI>
	Added a new scripting command to give control over which ligatures are output
	in an afm file
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    (it used to be that all ligatures were output in the afm file, no only 'liga'
	    and 'rlig' that appear in a default language are output)
	</UL>
      <LI>
	AFM files only support 2 character ligatures. So, when possible, generate
	a sort of closure on the ligatures. So if we are given the two ligs "ffi-&gt;f
	f i" and "ff-&gt;f f" then add the ligature "ffi-&gt;ff i". This means that
	the sequence f+f-&gt;ff+i-&gt;ffi will eventually reach the ligature we want.
      <LI>
	Changed so that an untitled anchor class is now called "Anchor-*" rather
	than "Untitled-*".
      <LI>
	Rewrote Merge &amp; Simplify commands. In my tests they now produce better
	results.
      <LI>
	Type2 font generation did not make use of hv/vh curveto commands in some
	cases
      <LI>
	When figuring out whether to synchronize the width/lbearing of a base character
	with the composits containing it, I only checked if the base character was
	alphabetic. But that doesn't work for hebrew where unicode says the marks
	are alphabetic. So add an additional check that it can't be a combining
	character.
      <LI>
	When pasting a composite character from one font to another, the saved width
	is not useful. Added a check that finds the correct width of the appropriate
	base character.
      <LI>
	When pasting a composite character from a font with one em-size to another
	with a different em-size try to scale the amount references are translated
	by an appropriate amount.
      <LI>
	CharInfo scripting command has been extended to allow users to test the presence
	of substitutions
      <LI>
	Some fonts (bsmi00lp.ttf for one) have bad cmap tables which map several
	glyphs to the same unicode code point. Put in a check for this and only map
	one glyph to that code point now.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    13-Mar-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Add a preference item to control the number of undoes saved per character
      <LI>
	Turn off saving undoes when in a script started from the command line
      <LI>
	Added a preference item to control the undo depth from the UI.
      <LI>
	Try to do better about scaling my chunk allocator to machines with 8 byte
	pointers
      <LI>
	Was doing 32 bit arithmetic when reading GSUB simple substitution lookups
	when I should have done 16 bit.
      <LI>
	Tracked down a lot of memory leaks with valgrind (and some uninitialized
	variables too)
      <LI>
	Added access to a font's version from scripting
      <LI>
	Added PostNotice scripting command
      <LI>
	When reading a ttf/otf font with a GSUB table pfaedit will try to guess
	reasonable names for unnamed glyphs by looking them up in the GSUB table.
	Thus an unnamed vertical varient for "A" might be named "A.vrt2".
      <LI>
	PfaEdit would crash when outputting ttf files with no 'cvt' table (bug introduced
	around 27-Feb)
      <LI>
	the configure script did not respect the argument --with-freetype-src as
	it should have.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    10-Mar-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Added a TrueType instruction debugger (actually an interface to FreeType's
	truetype bytecode interpreter)
	<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING="6" WIDTH="50%" ALIGN=CENTER>
	  <TR>
	    <TD BGCOLOR="#ffff00">This command depend on your compiling freetype with

	</TABLE>
      <LI>
	Added an Edit-&gt;Copy Grid Fit command (to put the grid fit splines into
	the clipboard)
      <LI>
	Added a warning if the freetype library doesn't have a byte code interpreter
	so that the user knows his/her splines have been autohinted (rather than
	had the bytecode instructions run).
      <LI>
	Improved Edit-&gt;Merge in some cases that don't fit its constraints
      <LI>
	KANOU found some more underscores in character names
