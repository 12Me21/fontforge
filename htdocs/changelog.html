	  Integrated Raph Levien's spiro curves. Note to packagers: Raph's spiro
	  stuff is GPL, so I have deliberately farmed it off into a separate
	  library.

	<LI>
	  Add <CODE>Edit-&gt;Select-&gt;Autohintable</CODE>
	<LI>
	  Typo in parsing cmap format=6 subtables could cause a crash (or eccentric
	  behavior)
	<LI>
	  Can build fontforge so that it is a python extension (as well as embedding
	  python in ff).
	  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	    <PRE>$ ./configure --enable-pyextension
</PRE>
	  </BLOCKQUOTE>
	<LI>
	  If a tt spline had a control point on top of an on-curve point we would lose
	  track of it when generating the font.
	<LI>
	  Add support for the Uncode variation subtable of the 'cmap' encoding table
	  (format=14).
	<LI>
	  add xdg-open to the list of "known" browsers.
	<LI>
	  Patch from Torsten Bronger. Got the args wrong in (python) font.glyphs.
	<LI>
	  Fabrice Popineau &amp; Taco Hoekwater point out that in the featurefile output
	  routines I was using a single backslash inside a printf string. The intent
	  was to output a single backslash. But I actually need to quote the backslash
	  with another to do that.
	<LI>
	  If a text string were extremely long it could overflow the 16 bits allowed
	  for a width in a metrixedit column. Truncate to 32767 in that case. Still
	  can't scroll over the whole thing, but editing it will pop up a better view
	  which will allow it all to be displayed.
	<LI>
	  If there are no slots in the current encoding, then clicking on the encoding
	  menu caused a crash.
	<LI>
	  Give the user control over the code pages/unicode ranges fields of the OS/2
	  table. Add python scripting commands to access them too.
	<LI>
	  When the user renames a glyph then things dependant on it should change
	  too.<BR>
	  So if any substitution (or pairwise positioning) refers to the old name,
	  change it to refer to the new.<BR>
	  If any contextual change refers to the old name change to the new.<BR>
	  If any class of glyphs (kerning class, apple state machine, contextual by
	  classes) refers to the old name change to the new.
	  <P>
	  More debateable: if we change "f" to "u0066" then change "f.sc" to "u0066.sc"
	  and "f_f_l" to "u0066_u0066_l" (and recurse on those name changes).
	<LI>
	  Guess at the meaning for GDEF glyph class component glyph:
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      Something not encoded
	    <LI>
	      Something which is refered to by at least one other glyph (as a reference)
	    <LI>
	      Something which is not generated by GSUB
	  </UL>
	<LI>
	  Further improvements to the auto instructor.
	<LI>
	  Make the [Guess] button in FontInfo-&gt;Private active when BlueScale is
	  selected. (and make it work too).
	<LI>
	  Oops. A font member in python was mis-named. Documented to be "loadState"
	  was "loadStyle". Corrected to match the documentation.
	<LI>
	  Some of the 'maxp' checks in the validator were off by 1, so fontlint would
	  report errors on the glyph with the maximum value.
	<LI>
	  Validator was checking non-composite glyphs against composite boundries.
	<LI>
	  Barry Schwartz points out that I should validate the PostScript Private
	  dictionary (Check that entries have the right types, check that BlueValues:
	  has an even number of elements, is in order, that pairs are separated by
	  bluefuzz*2+1, not too big for bluescale etc.).
	<LI>
	  FF would crash when building accented glyphs from unicode data that included
	  a space as the base glyph.
	<LI>
	  Torsten Bronger points out that "import" is a python keyword and can't (easily)
	  be used as a member/method name. So change the glyph.import function to
	  importOutlines.
	<LI>
	  Patch by Mathias Kilian OpenBSD needs an include file linux doesn't (or rather
	  that linux imports in another include file) declaration statement mixup.
	<LI>
	  Patch by Michal Nowakowski to disambiguate some strings and to make sure
	  some others get translated.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      17-Sept-2007
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Patch from Daniel Johnson. FF didn't compile --with-regular-link
	<LI>
	  And FF didn't compile if it had libpng but not libjpeg
	<LI>
	  Added some warning messages when doing AutoInstr so that if a font does not
	  contain a private dictionary, or if none of the selected glyphs contain hints,
	  then let the user know s/he isn't going to get very useful instructions.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      15-Sept-2007
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Added the ability to upload a font to the
	  <A HREF="http://www.openfontlibrary.org/">open font library</A>. (You need
	  to have created an account with them first).
	<LI>
	  Further improvements to the auto instructor.
	<LI>
	  When all glyphs are selected and the user auto-instructs, then FontForge
	  will clear any legacy tables ('fpgm', 'prep' and 'cvt&nbsp;'). The old values
	  will be of no use, and they just get in the way.
	<LI>
	  Add a Edit-&gt;Select-&gt;Select by Script command<BR>
	  Make the Select by Name take a wildcard (so you could select "*.sc").
	<LI>
	  ApplySubstitutions still had problems. Caused crashes in a font with
	  instructions.
	<LI>
	  If one used the metrics view to create a kerning lookup then: there would
	  be no 'kern' feature in the feature list yet, and the display would randomly
	  lose track of kern pairs and then create new ones. Very confusing.
	<LI>
	  Hmm. In some cases Merge Fonts didn't copy over lookup info.<BR>
	  Add the ability to merge cross-font kerning pairs (in case the two fonts
	  being merged have the same glyphs for those which are in both fonts).
	<LI>
	  Provide a mass glyph rename menu item.
	<LI>
	  The [Merge] button in Font Info-&gt;Lookups was disabled when two subtables
	  in the first lookup were selected.
	<LI>
	  If a glyph ended in a suffix (one.superior, etc.), then changes to that glyph
	  were not reflected in the fontview.
	<LI>
	  Add the ability to Populate a lookup from the selection (in the lookup sub-table
	  dialogs)<BR>
	  Do a better job of providing default values for single substitutions &amp;
	  positions.
	<LI>
	  In the Print/Display dlg, deleting something so that the next line was blank
	  caused ff to crash.
	<LI>
	  The Encoding-&gt;Make From Font menu item should be disabled if the encoding
	  is not custom.
	<LI>
	  Fixed a system specific crash in the BDF Info window.
	<LI>
	  Major rewrite of tilepath. Now has initial, medial, final &amp; isolated
	  tiles which it will use depending on the circumstances. No longer uses the
	  clipboard, but you can draw the tiles in the dlg.
	<LI>
	  In Italic/Oblique fonts (those where the font has an italic angle specified)
	  make the center in width command correct for the italic angle.
	<LI>
	  Round to Int didn't round anchor points.
	<LI>
	  The Control Point Info window could wander off the bottom of the screen.
	  I was very carefully calculating its position -- and then not using the result.
	<LI>
	  InkScape stuffs bitmap images into svg files using the data URI<BR>
	  &nbsp; &nbsp;data:&lt;mimetype&gt;,&lt;data&gt;<BR>
	  (see IETF standard RFC 2397)
	  <P>
	  So, I'll support this now as my only way of handling type3 style svg fonts
	  with embedded bitmaps.
	  <P>
	  The standard points out that URIs are limitted to 1024 bytes, but I don't
	  pay any attention to that restriction, and will stuff arbetrary sized images
	  into these things.
	<LI>
	  The code that set up python import/export filters did not put an end of list
	  entry after the last one. Sometimes it would be NULL (correct) and things
	  would work and sometimes it would be garbage and things would crash.
	<LI>
	  Drat. In the outline glyph view, the Import command didn't set the filter
	  properly when you changed the import type.
	<LI>
	  Extend fontforge to keep track of errors encountered when loading 'sfnt'
	  files, and then have fontlint complain about them.
	  <P>
	  Also extend fontlint to do validity checking in glyphs against the 'maxp'
	  table. (This won't matter when editing fonts, as ff will fixup the maxp values
	  when it generates the font, but there might be some existing fonts with buggy
	  'maxp' values).
	<LI>
	  Oops. When changing the weight of a glyph and retaining the counter sizes,
	  fontforge would push two entries onto the undo stack rather than one. (So
	  the user would have to do Edit-&gt;Undo twice to get back to where s/he started
	  from).
	<LI>
	  Added several new python methods to font.
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      find(contour) will search the font for all glyphs containing contour and
	      return an interator on that set.
	    <LI>
	      replaceAll(srch,rpl) Will search for the "srch" contour/layer in the font
	      and replace it (each time it occurs) with the "rpl" contour/layer.
	    <LI>
	      glyphs(type) returns an iterator over all glyphs in the font. If present
	      type may be "GID" (default if omitted) or "encoding" and it indicates the
	      order in which the glyphs will be returned.
	  </UL>
	  <P>
	  Added some new members to glyph:
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      encoding -- returns the glyph's encoding in the font
	    <LI>
	      script -- returns the OpenType tag (a 4 letter string) of the script of this
	      glyph.
	  </UL>
      </UL>
    <LI>
      31-August-2007
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  New traditional Chinese translation of the UI by Wei-Lun Chao.
	<LI>
	  Updated Vietnamese translation by Clytie Siddall.
	<LI>
	  Removed the old MetaFont command (which didn't work) and replaced it with
	  a styles menu (incorporating the old Effects menu, and a command to change
	  weight, to condense/extend, and to oblique. Added python scripting commands
	  {font,glyph}.{changeWeight,condenseExtend}
	<LI>
	  Lots of new work on the truetype autoinstructor by Alexej and Michal.
	<LI>
	  Add a validation dialog which can be run just before generating a font.
	<LI>
	  Try a different algorithm for approximating splines by line segments (for
	  drawing them in the outline glyph view and elsewhere). This one should show
	  symmetry better.
	<LI>
	  Provide the ability to ask freetype to rasterize glyphs without hints in
	  the Print/Display dlg (even if the glyphs have hints, rasterize them without).
	<LI>
	  Oh dear, rasterizing stroked fonts only worked if multilayer was defined.
	<LI>
	  Try to improve display of stroked fonts.
	<LI>
	  When stroking splines don't let miter joins grow excessively.
	<LI>
	  FF would remove instructions from glyphs that had at least two contours the
	  first of which started with a control point.
	<LI>
	  Add a short cut for Hide Grid in the metrics view.
	<LI>
	  Python 2.5 initializes itself differently from Python 2.[34]. 2.[34] delay
	  the init until an import happens, while 2.5 does it at start up. I just assumed
	  that when I called Py_Initialize that it did so. This led to a crash on 2.[34]
	  when I tried to use my types before the user had tried to import fontforge.
	<LI>
	  Further improvements to tile path.
	<LI>
	  When moving a control point in a ttf font where one side of the cp was a
	  real point, I would allow an implicit point on the far side of the real point
	  to become real.
	<LI>
	  When dragging truetype points around, adjacent implicit points would remain
	  where they were (and not be implicit any longer).
	<LI>
	  FF would randomly crash after removing a lot of glyphs.
	<LI>
	  The knife tool would not cut a contour if it landed on a point.
	<LI>
	  Trying to add a stylename to the size pane of fontinfo generally caused a
	  crash.
	<LI>
	  All blank lines in the display dlg had the same line spacing as that of the
	  first character displayed in the dlg.
	<LI>
	  I don't think feature files where handling classes defined with '-' properly.
	<LI>
	  Read the "lib" structures from UFO/GLIF files into our python persistent
	  data. (And write our persistent data out if it's a dict).
	<LI>
	  Add the ability to call hooks (python functions) when various fontforge events
	  take place.
	<LI>
	  Make fontforge's basic types (Point, Contour, and Layer) be picklable so
	  they can now be saved in an sfd file.
	<LI>
	  Oops. With the inclusion of the library check argument, ff would not compile
	  if NODYNAMIC were set.
	<LI>
	  FontForge now stores the "userdata" python members into the sfd file as pickled
	  objects. (FontForge's own types are not currently pickleable).
	<LI>
	  Add the ability to mark a glyph so that just before being saved its references
	  will be unlinked and we will run remove overlap on it. This means the user
	  can work with the references (and get the automatic updating they confer)
	  and still not have a self-intersecting glyph in the output (think Aring,
	  Ccedilla, Eogonek).
	<LI>
	  Create a fontlint script file.
	<LI>
	  When dumping both apple and opentype bitmap tables if there were a BDF table,
	  then we'd get garbage for 'bloc'/'bhed'.
	<LI>
	  Add some user interface commands to python, and more importantly, add the
	  ability to create menu items which will invoke python scripts, and the ability
	  to add import/export conversion filters (again, python scripts).
	<LI>
	  Counter hints for LCG glyphs came out wrong if autohint had not been applied
	  first.
	<LI>
	  Counter masks were not read out of sfd files properly.
	<LI>
	  Selecting a counter mask in Glyph Info caused FF to crash.
	<LI>
	  The Execute Script dlg would sometimes complain about invalid scrollbar size
	  when it got closed.
	<LI>
	  AddAnchorPoint (scripting command) should be prepared to cast real args to
	  integers.
	<LI>
	  Just as I needed a special "in use" pass of GSUB when reading from a TTC,
	  so I also need an "in use" pass of the MATH table.
	<LI>
	  All this time and I've mapped "nonmarkingreturn" (GID=2) to Unicode+000C
	  instead of Unicode+000D. I'm a twit.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      08-August-2007
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Support for MicroSoft's new 'MATH' opentype table.
	  <A href="math.html">Element-&gt;Math Info</A>.
	<LI>
	  Michal Nowakowski and Alexej Kryukov have improved truetype hinting.
	<LI>
	  kerning display is off in a pairwise lookup window if a y position adjustment
	  were requested.
	<LI>
	  When reverting a compacted font ff thought the font was compacted even when
	  it was not.
	<LI>
	  Make some effort to retain context in the fontview when changing encodings.
	<LI>
	  ff scripting command CopyReference() was broken.
	<LI>
	  Werner wants little popup windows in show att. Give him some for substitutions.
	<LI>
	  If you examined a kerning pair subtable (either with glyph info or from double
	  clicking on the subtable in the lookup pane) and then pressed [OK], and then
	  generated an afm (tfm, old-style kern table, etc.) you would lose all the
	  kern pairs you examined.
	<LI>
	  Patch by Barry SCHWARTZ to feature file output on 64bit machines.
	<LI>
	  In freetype 2.3.5 the binary layout of the execution context changed.<BR>
	  This means that if ff is compiled against a 2.3.4 library it can't debug
	  truetype if linked with a 2.3.5 library (and vice versa).<BR>
	  So put in checks to see that the library version matches what we expect.
	  <P>
	  Also the contents of one of the structures has changed a bit, and a value
	  that used to live in one field has moved to another (the ppem value moved
	  from (exc)-&gt;size-&gt;metrics.x_ppem to
	  (exc)-&gt;size-&gt;root.metrics.x_ppem.
	  <P>
	  Well, David warned me that this might happen.
	  <P>
	  Warn the user (rather than just silently failing) when we have a freetype
	  version mismatch.
	<LI>
	  Patch from Barry SCHWARTZ. python fontforge.font.addPosSub was expecting
	  its args inside a redundant tuple.
	<LI>
	  New Vietnamese translation from Clytie.<BR>
	  Also some spelling corrections in the original messages.
	<LI>
	  Patch by Barry SCHWARTZ to lookup/subtable comparison.
	<LI>
	  If a metricsview was open, then creating a new glyph slot would potentially
	  screw up memory and sometimes crashed.
	<LI>
	  Edit-&gt;Merge (and simplify) still have bugs.
	<LI>
	  Fix two memory leaks in the metrics view (one was huge).
	<LI>
	  If freetype failed to rasterize a glyph, then we would fall back on returning
	  a bitmap image from our own rasterizer -- even if we asked freetype for a
	  greymap. this caused problems when routines expected byte data rather than
	  bit data.
	<LI>
	  If we were given a cff (otf) font, with a bluevalues array which ended in
	  0 (as [-20 0]) then we would omit the final zero ([-20]).
	<LI>
	  Outputting extension subtables appears to have been broken.
	<LI>
	  The code which was supposed to detect two glyphs with the same set of kerning
	  pairs and use the same data for them didn't work (forcing us to get an extension
	  table which also didn't work).
	<LI>
	  Add some more checks against non-BMP characters when drawing text.
	<LI>
	  For first characters in the kern pair dlg, when editing class 0, the [Edit]
	  button was enabled but did nothing. Should work now.
	<LI>
	  ff could crash if it tried to create a popup image of the &lt;New&gt; line
	  in the substitution pane of Glyph Info.
	<LI>
	  Horizontal Scrolling in the matrix edit widget sometimes forgot to move the
	  column labels.
	<LI>
	  Add glyph name completion to lookup subtable dlg and glyph info panes.
	<LI>
	  addKerningClass didn't parse its arguments correctly.
	<LI>
	  Drat. When printing full page glyphs to a pdf file, the glyph was shifted
	  up by almost the full page and we got a second (and incorrect) title.
	<LI>
	  MS proposes two new feature tags with it's new 'MATH' table.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      23-July-2007
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  I have merged (and substantially rewritten) the Print and Display Dialogs.
	  There is now only one menu item (Print) which (vaguely) the old Display dlg
	  except that it can now be printed. The text area widget now supports OpenType
	  features just as the metrics view does. It also supports ligature carets.
	  <P>
	  The dialog is no longer modal, however it does not get updated with each
	  change to the font (that would make moving a point around in the outline
	  view far too sluggish), instead there is a [Refresh] button the user can
	  press to force an update.
	<LI>
	  It occurred to me that fontforge's current mechanism for setting ligature
	  carets requires that there be a ligature substitution is the exact number
	  of components used to make the glyph. But in indic fonts ligatures are often
	  made up out of other ligatures (I think) which means that there won't be
	  enough caret positions.
	  <P>
	  So I've added a Ligature Caret count to the Element-&gt;Glyph Info dialog
	  to give the user control over it when necessary.
	<LI>
	  Add minimal support for applying apple state machine lookups in metrics view.
	  Support is minimal because:
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      Apple seems to figure line breaks before doing substitution process but I
	      do it afterward so I don't know where the line breaks are and I can't enter
	      either the line start or line end state.
	    <LI>
	      When I delete a glyph I delete it. Apple inserts a deleted glyph mark and
	      then removes that later. State machines can respond to deleted glyphs, but
	      I can't.
	    <LI>
	      I don't try to figure out which feature,settings should be on by default.
	      So the user must pick them out manually.
	  </UL>
	<LI>
	  Add popup graphics to the Glyph Info and Lookup subtable dialogs to show
	  substitutions (that is if there is an entry like 'smcp' a =&gt; a.sc then
	  create a popup window showing the "a" glyph and the "a.sc" so the user can
	  see what happens.
	<LI>
	  Another futile attempt at an embolden command. Element-&gt;Embolden
	<LI>
	  Add shortcuts to the anchor control dlg (Page Up/Page Down) to move to the
	  next/previous glyph.
	<LI>
	  Michal Nowakowski has improved the truetype autoinstructor. He warns that
	  it probably still has bugs (as what does not?) so I am leaving the old code
	  available for now. He says it works best in "a clean (uninstructed) font
	  with well defined blue zones and stems".
	<LI>
	  If we have a glyph with multiple encodings, and the secondary encodings occur
	  after the primary ones, then the backmap will probably contain a secondary
	  encoding, which means that when we go to load the font in we will probably
	  notice the secondary encoding twice and forget the primary.
	<LI>
	  I used not to distinguish between ligature anchors and normal mark to base
	  anchors. Unfortunately when I moved to lookups (from features) I had to introduce
	  that distinction. But I didn't work through all the implications and have
	  fixed a number of bugs related to that.
	<LI>
	  Barry SCHWARTZ complains that font info says "fontnames must" but that the
	  cited adobe tech note only says "should". So change "must" to "should".
	<LI>
	  When processing class-based contextual lookups fontforge could not handle
	  class 0 (the class containing "all glyphs not in another class") add code
	  to do that.
	<LI>
	  If the user did not select a Gasp Version (note: active selection was needed,

	  I've redone the way FontForge handles lookups so that it is more in keeping
	  with OpenType.
	  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	    The major change is that fontforge now presents lookups to the user rather
	    than features. I think this makes simple things more difficult (which is
	    why I avoided this when I started), but it makes complex things possible.
	    <P>
	    Sadly the world is not simple.
	    <P>
	    So when a piece of typographic information is created (a ligature, a kern
	    pair, a glyph substitution, etc.) it must be tagged with a lookup (actually
	    a lookup sub-table) rather than a feature tag.
	    <P>
	    The lookup itself will be tagged with a feature tag (possibly several tags)
	    and with scripts and languages in which that lookup should be active.<BR>
	    <STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> This reverses the way GPOS/GSUB think about things,
	    but it contains the same information.
	    <P>
	    The <A href="fontinfo.html#Lookups">Font Info</A> dialog now contains a Lookup
	    pane which allows you to create and edit lookups and their subtables. You
	    can also reorder them. The order shown in the dialog is the order in which
	    they will be applied.
	    <P>
	    A mac feature/setting subtable also gets converted into this format.
	    <P>
	    The Font Info dialog no longer has Anchor Classes, Contextual, or State Machine
	    panes.
	    <P>
	    Instead you can edit a lookup subtable's data (for any subtable type). There
	    are new dialogs which list all the information for each lookup type (ie.
	    a dialog which lists all kern pairs in a subtable), and these provide access
	    to the old anchor class, contextual or state machine dialogs.
	    <P>
	    The Glyph Info command has also changed. It looks simpler and more comprehensible
	    (I think), but the act of creating a new substitution has become more complex
	    because (potentially) one must create a new lookup and lookup subtable before
	    doing the simple task of adding a new replacement glyph.
	    <P>
	    The kerning class, contextual and state machine dialogs have all changed
	    in that they no longer request a feature tag, they now need a lookup subtable.
	    <P>
	    The metrics view also needs a subtable.<BR>
	    The metrics view has changed considerably.<BR>
	    It displays all the features in the font, and allows you to select which
	    ones you want active in the view. It lets you set the script &amp; language.
	    It will apply lookups that it couldn't handle previously like ligatures and
	    contextuals.
	    <P>
	    It does not do Indic glyph reordering. I'm not sure how to and last I checked
	    MS had not updated their docs to reflect their new procedures.
	    <P>
	    Many other dialogs now take a lookup subtable where appropriate.
	    <P>
	    Show ATT has changed, but it is still not editable. I hope that the Lookups
	    pane will do that instead.
	    <P>
	    There used to be a scripting command which indicated what ligature features
	    got stored in afm files. Now each ligature lookup has a flag set on it which
	    conveys this information.
	    <P>
	    The Element-&gt;Typographic Features menu has been removed. It's functionality
	    has moved into Font Info-&gt;Lookups (I hope I've got everything).
	    <P>
	    Some scripting commands have been removed, others have been changed and others
	    have been added. I apologize for this, as it will break existing scripts,
	    but some basic concepts no longer exist and others, very different, have

	<LI>
	  Add a button to insert the <A HREF="http://scripts.sil.org/ofl/">SIL Open
	  Font License</A> into the 'name' table.
	<LI>
	  FF failed to store TeX heights and depths properly in a tfm file. FF failed
	  to read or write TeX extension lists properly.
	<LI>
	  Patch from Reuben Thomas to turn off the splash screen from the preference
	  dlg.
	<LI>
	  I had the dotlessj code point wrong. Again.
	<LI>
	  FF did not center the charview window well on an empty glyph.
	<LI>
	  The scripting command to add instructions to a glyph could immediately lose
	  them if the glyph's points weren't numbered properly
	<LI>
	  We used to allow the syntax "&lt;number&gt;&lt;numbers&gt;* command" in ttf
	  instructions (which automagically inserted an implied push). Someone noticed
	  that
	  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	    <PRE>PUSHB_1
1
2
</PRE>
	  </BLOCKQUOTE>
	  <P>
	  would lose the second number and not complain. In fixing that, I broke the
	  first. Now both should work (I hope).
	<LI>
	  Code which I hope will handle German keyboards and make them do what the
	  menu says they (ignoring the shift key) should for certain hot keys (brackets,
	  curly brackets, brokets all get different modifier sequences on a german
	  keyboard than an english).
	<LI>
	  If a glyph had no hints then ff could add a hintmask operator (which didn't
	  try to control any hints). Now I can't find anything in the docs which SAYS
	  it's illegal to have a hintmask in a glyph with no fonts, it does seem bad
	  practice, and a program called tx.exe complained about it.
	<LI>
	  Patch by Michal Nowakowski to allow a nicer notation for delta instructions
	  in the instruction editing window: Example:<BR>
	  <TT>PUSHB_3 6@12 8 1 DELTAP2 </TT><BR>
	  This moves point 8 by six delta-steps (that's clear) at 37 ppem (that's not
	  clear at first glance - assuming delta_base is 9, DELTAP2 works from 25 ppem
	  to 25+15 ppem, in this example it's 25+12 ppem). So it's just a way of
	  constructing an argument byte for DELTAP/C.
	<LI>
	  Allow FontForge's menu shortcuts (hot keys, whatever) to be user definable.
	  We use a gettext based mechanism, type $ make FontForge-MenuShortCuts.pot
	  to get a pot file for the process. It needs to be converted to an mo file
	  and installed in $(prefix)/share/locale/$(LANG)/LC_MESSAGES, just like any
	  other getext file.
	<LI>
	  The Export scripting command did not work as documented. It is documented
	  to export all <EM>selected</EM> glyphs. Instead it exported <EM>all</EM>
	  glyphs.
	<LI>
	  Redo the anchor control dlg.
	<LI>
	  Be a little more lenient about bitmap bounding boxes for empty glyphs when
	  loading bdf fonts
	<LI>
	  Make the ClearHints scripting command take arguments: "Horizontal" or "Vertical"
	  to allow users to choose to clear either horizontal or vertical hints (the
	  old form with no args still works and clears both, of course).
	<LI>
	  Typo gives us an unititialized variable when saving ufo.
	<LI>
	  Various problems to various anchor dialogs.
	<LI>
	  If an anchor point contained an x devtab but not a y devtab then it produced
	  a pointer to garbage for the y devtab instead of NUL.
	  <P>
	  Pairwise positioning lookups could also get their device table offsets screwed
	  up.
	<LI>
	  Werner points out that if you have a series of the same glyph in a row in
	  the encoding (generally .notdef) and you are in a char view, then pressing
	  Next Glyph does nothing. You are stuck at the same code point. (same thing
	  happens for Prev Glyph).
	<LI>
	  a chinese input method steals keystrokes I use for hot keys (I think). So
	  if users don't want glyph navigation by typing characters in the charview
	  (controled by a preference item) then don't turn on the input method when
	  the window is created.
	<LI>
	  Add hot key for Select-&gt;Points on selected contours.
	<LI>
	  Assign "dotlessj" to map to 0x237, the unicode code point, rather than to
	  0xf6be, the old Adobe private use area. !!!! THIS DOES NOT CONFORM TO THE
	  AGL !!!!!
	<LI>
	  Oops. The gloss for the shift point/contour/zone was slightly off and gave
	  the wrong information.
	<LI>
	  Add vietnamese font styles (bold, italic, regular, etc.)<BR>
	  From Clytie Siddall.
	<LI>
	  Fixes for rounding errors in finding spline intersections.
	<LI>
	  Werner points out that removing a bitmap glyph from the bitmapview does not
	  force a redisplay in the fontview.
	<LI>
	  Gleep. Werner points out that when generating bitmap strikes, ff would always
	  generate a temporary postscript font to rasterize, so any truetype instructions
	  would be ignored. And the generated strikes would be ugly.
	<LI>
	  Add a command to show anchor point attachments within the outline character
	  view<BR>
	  (View-&gt;Combinations-&gt;Anchor Glyph at Point)
	<LI>
	  Force point numbers to be correct when changing glyphs in the charview.
	<LI>
	  Add support for Apple/Adobe's obsolete 'typ1' sfnt. A way of stuffing a type1
	  font into an sfnt wrapper.
	<LI>
	  Even though the viewbox/output width hieght ratios are different, people
	  want the image scaled the same in svg input.
	<LI>
	  People would like to have only one charview and double clicking in the fontview
	  just changes the contents of an existing window.<BR>
	  Preference Item: OpenCharsInNewWindow
	<LI>
	  Add a tabs line to the outline char window. If users are going to have only
	  one charview open then they probably want some history too.
	<LI>
	  Werner points out that what I call "Type42 CID" should actually be called
	  either "Type11" or "CID Type 2".
