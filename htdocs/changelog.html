      <UL>
	<LI>
	  New translations: Greek, Simplified Chinese, German, Polish.
	<LI>
	  Using the help command would generally crash fontforge on cygwin.
	<LI>
	  Adobe uses the American spelling of diaeresis (that is dieresis), but some
	  fonts contain glyph names with the European spelling. So add that as an
	  alternate.
	<LI>
	  If a bdf font contained an unencoded .notdef glyph, then we crashed.
	<LI>
	  Adding Greek translations for font styles. (Thanks to Apostolos)
	<LI>
	  If we aren't dealing with a TeX math font, then the "Sub/super"script positioning
	  fields of Glyph Info-&gt;TeX aren't meaningful. So grey them out.
	<LI>
	  Remove internal/external did the wrong thing in expand stroke if we also
	  removed overlap and had counter-clockwise splines.
	<LI>
	  Alexej Kryukov points out that reverting a glyph with anchors lost the anchors.
	<LI>
	  Add simplified Chinese style names to our built-in lists.
	<LI>
	  Problem reading autotraced input.
	<LI>
	  The encoding change of last summer broke tfm output with glyph lists or extension
	  characters.
	<LI>
	  If add extrema added a point too close to a start/end point expand stroke
	  could generate NaNs.
	<LI>
	  FF could crash when adding extrema to an open contour.
	<LI>
	  Add Polish styles to the translation list.
	<LI>
	  Add a scripting function to set the gasp table.
	<LI>
	  Add support for the 'gasp' table.
	<LI>
	  Alexej Kryukov wants format 6 cmap tables.
	<LI>
	  After editing instructions the debugger would incorrectly complain that
	  instructions were out of date.
	<LI>
	  Michal Nowakowski complains that "Instructions are out of date" warning appears
	  too many times when doing a global transformation. Make it only pop up as
	  a dlg once and thereafter occur as a LogError.
	<LI>
	  If a font contained only space glyphs it could still be marked onlybitmaps
	  and not allow outline generation.
	<LI>
	  Show ATT did not translate scripts &amp; languages.
	<LI>
	  Parsing an empty list of ttf instructions crashed Michael Zedler's machine.
	<LI>
	  Make type1 generation use (essentially) the same subroutine mechanism as
	  type2.
	<LI>
	  Local subroutines were being freed twice in cff cid-keyed font generation.
	<LI>
	  Removing an alternate unicode encoding (Detach Glyphs) was broken in some
	  cases.
	<LI>
	  FF failed to perform some simplifications on the last spline of a closed
	  contour.
	<LI>
	  Various fixes for Michal N.
	<LI>
	  Add scripting interfaces to many of the ctype functions.
	<LI>
	  Add a scripting interface to the 'size' feature, now that Adobe has finally
	  decided what to do about 'size'.
	<LI>
	  Had the wrong title for kerning state machine dlgs.
	<LI>
	  Redo the preference dlg.
	<LI>
	  The two preference items, AlwaysGenApple, and AlwaysGenOpenType, were a bad
	  choice on my part and have lead to considerable confusion. I mentioned some
	  time ago that I would remove them if there were no objection.
	  <P>
	  There was no objection.
	  <P>
	  I have now removed them.
	  <P>
	  I also made the SetPrefs scripting function sort of work if the user tries
	  to set one of these (it will set the appropriate flags in the default option
	  set used by generate).
	  <P>
	  The defaults of these flags were different on the Mac from everywhere else.
	  This meant that a script could do different things on the Mac and on linux.
	  That seems like a bad idea. I have changed things so that the default options
	  setting for generate is always OpenType.
	  <P>
	  <STRONG>THIS IS AN INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE AND SCRIPTS ON THE MAC COULD NOW BEHAVE
	  DIFFERENTLY.</STRONG>
	<LI>
	  Patch from Michal Nowakowski to have ff number points after conversion to
	  quadratic.
	<LI>
	  Try to provide disambiguation for all strings "New" so that in languages
	  where "New" must agree in gender with the thing being created translators
	  will be happier.
	<LI>
	  Remove the po/Makefile.in and redo the configure script to build it (so that
	  I don't have to modify it each time I get a new language).
	<LI>
	  Extend the knife tool so that if Meta (Alt) is held down it will move any
	  spline it intersects (rather than cutting the spline).
	<LI>
	  FF would crash if $HOME (the directory that is, not the environment variable)
	  did not exist.
	<LI>
	  I guess it makes sense that if ff read in a compressed sfd file then using
	  a simple File-&gt;Save command (not Save As) should produce another compressed
	  sfd file.
	<LI>
	  When scaling a reference in otf output we had problems if the reference had
	  more than one contour.
	<LI>
	  If we deleted many glyphs from a font we are sometimes left with kern pairs
	  pointing to things not worth outputting. Make sure we don't generate kerning
	  info for them.
	<LI>
	  Ligature carets were not being scaled by scale to em.
	<LI>
	  Patch from mfabian at suse.
	<LI>
	  If a user has a font with a glyph that is bigger than 16*em-size (in many
	  dimensions) and that user generates a tfm file, then warn him that the glyph
	  can't be expressed in a tfm file and truncate the size to the biggest legal
	  value.
	<LI>
	  Attempt to mitigate the effects of X claiming to have a font when it doesn't.
	<LI>
	  Saving CID keyed fonts would look at garbage memory for its encoding data
	  if not saved from the biggest subfont.
	<LI>
	  Add support for version 4 of the OS/2 table.
	<LI>
	  If Interpretation was set in a font then when generating a 8/16 type cmap
	  fontforge always went down the traditional chinese (big5) branch.
	<LI>
	  MS has changed their indic shaping engine. It still uses the same features
	  but they are applied differently. To disambiguate this change they have created
	  a parallel set of script tags for the indic writing system. FontForge should
	  recognize these and use them when appropriate.
	<LI>
	  When Adobe first released fonts with a 'size' feature they did not follow
	  the opentype specification. In August of 2006 they announced an incompatible
	  change to bring fonts produced after that date in line with the specification.
	  Unfortunately there are programs which depend on the old, broken format.
	  <P>
	  Legacy programs will not work when given a font in the correct format. New
	  programs should be able to handle either correct or broken 'size' features.
	  <P>
	  FontForge should now be able to read in a size feature in either format and
	  gives the user the option of producing 'size' features in either format on
	  output.
	<LI>
	  For Japanese fonts we tried to use cp932 (a variant of sjis) but then halfway
	  through didn't know what to do with it.
	<LI>
	  Another fix for saving sub-opentype fonts from a cid font.
	<LI>
	  From a script, if a user asks to generate a ttf outline font with ttf bitmaps
	  from a database with no outlines then technically this isn't supposed to
	  work. But it used to and it's easy enough to tweak so that it works again.
	<LI>
	  <STRONG>Update to Unicode 5.0</STRONG>
	<LI>
	  Again when adding accents to the left of a glyph we should shift the glyph
	  over to give it a reasonable lbearing.
	<LI>
	  When building an accented glyph, we generally want use_my_metrics set on
	  the reference. But if we add an accent to right (horn) or left (psili/varia
	  on cap greeks) we want to turn it off. We did turn it off on the right side,
	  but not on the left.
	<LI>
	  Philipp Poll points out that ScaleToEm doesn't scale the OS/2 metrics (and
	  some other stuff). Actually it does, but font info did the scaling BEFORE
	  setting the values. So the metrics get scaled, and then reset to the values
	  in fontinfo (which usually means they don't get changed).
	<LI>
	  Fix some memory leaks.
	<LI>
	  Some fixes for pcf loading.
	<LI>
	  Various fixes to CID keyed fonts.
	<LI>
	  Even the pretty ttf approximation routines need to worry about diametrically
	  opposed control points.
	<LI>
	  When generating multiple type1 fonts, output the bounding box of each as
	  that of the full font. This will make it vaguely likely that applications
	  will get the same line spacing.
	<LI>
	  Oops. The vertical metrics bit wasn't preserved when flattening a cid font.
	<LI>
	  Ack! Window titles and such were being interpreted in Latin1 and not in UTF-8.
	<LI>
	  Interpretation of PostScript arc operator failed if the two angles were 360
	  degrees apart. Normalization made them both the same.
	<LI>
	  Try to clean up bitmap only sfnt generation.
	<LI>
	  pcf wasn't in the Open Font dialog format list (nor was pmf, nor pdf)<BR>
	  Add a filter for TeX bitmap fonts.
	<LI>
	  Provide a mechanism (if a preference item is set) for picking a cmap when
	  loading a font.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      22-Aug-2006
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Add a pane to the Preference dlg allowing user to control some of fontforge's
	  hint creation.
	<LI>
	  Someone complained that Find Problems-&gt;Path Direction got the wrong answer.
	  It got the wrong answer because they had a self-intersecting path (which
	  screws up all concepts of in/out-side. So try to make it clear that they
	  should do a find intersecting paths first.
	<LI>
	  Update my opentype scripts list (in particular include music).
	<LI>
	  Due to a typo, ff thought pretty much everything outside unicode BMP was
	  in the hebrew script.
	<LI>
	  Add a new command to the point menu which allows you to specify a spline
	  and one coordinate (either X or Y) on that spline. FF will calculate the
	  other coordinate and add a point there.
	<LI>
	  CODE2000 contains an anchor class with only base glyphs (no mark glyphs)
	  as part of a set of anchor classes. FF crashed.
	<LI>
	  Patch by Nix. svg.c did not compile when designed to be linked directly with
	  libxml (instead of dlopening it).
	<LI>
	  Redo the font open dlg so that there's a list of standard filters and a mechanism
	  for changing that list. Remember the last filter used.
	<LI>
	  If a popup menu is huge it used to appear under the cursor. This meant that
	  even if the user didn't mean to s/he would have selected something and
	  press/release would not be a no-op. This was a problem with the Font Info
	  -&gt;TTF Names
	<LI>
	  Patch from SUSE. Use of uninitialized local variable. But the result is never
	  used, so just remove the offending lines.
	<LI>
	  Emulate gtk's boxes and use that to do automatic dialog layout. Get the font
	  info dlg working (and then several others too). This means that the layout
	  is no longer optimized for English, but will look better in other languages
	  (I hope).
	<LI>
	  Add an information to Font Info to display what unicode character ranges
	  are supplied by the font.
	<LI>
	  Philipp Poll points out that when generating versioned fonts (ie. Ambrosia-1.0
	  rather than just Ambrosia) you don't want the filename to default to the
	  fontname (the fontname will be Ambrosia), instead you want some way of specifying
	  a default filename. So add that to the Names pane of the Font Info dlg.
	<LI>
	  Try to keep track of font creation and modification times. NOTE: This is
	  different from file times (which is what appears to be stored in the 'head'
	  table of an sfnt file). Add a new table 'FFTM' to our sfnt output with these
	  timestamps (and the timestamp of fontforge itself, just in case we ever care).
	<LI>
	  Mark classes could not be set from the selection.
	<LI>
	  Ben Laenen points out that if an order2 glyph has a dependent which refers
	  to it using point matching and we keep changing the point number on the glyph
	  then we'll keep getting warning messages. He suggests one message.
	<LI>
	  Empty glyphs weren't marked with red Xs any more.
	<LI>
	  In font compare, when comparing two contextual/chaining lookups, I forgot
	  that class[0] was always NULL.
	<LI>
	  Open contours caused the ttf point renumberer to crash.
	<LI>
	  A font can have many kerning pairs. More than will fit in one GPOS subtable
	  (which essentially has a 64k data limit or a bit more than 10,000 kern pairs).
	  So be prepared to generate many sub-tables each dealing with a subset of
	  the (first) glyphs.
	<LI>
	  If an apple mutually exclusive feature had a default setting which wasn't
	  0 then my previous patch didn't work.
	<LI>
	  If guessing bluevalues found no OtherBlues, fontinfo-&gt;PS Private would
	  create an incorrect OtherBlues value [0]
	<LI>
	  Support clipboards containing image/svg
	<LI>
	  Ralf Stubner points out that the maximum zone size of bluezones is determined
	  by 1/BlueScale. So adjust BlueScale if the max zone is too big.
	<LI>
	  Merge fonts didn't merge anchors and got into a terrible mess. Let's merge
	  kern classes and state machines too. Merging kern classes may be a bad idea.
	  We don't really merge them we just copy them so that if the same glyph is
	  mentioned in two classes unexpected things might happen.
	<LI>
	  ff could crash on an sfd file containing erroneous anchors (such as might
	  be generated by the merge fonts command).
	<LI>
	  Once upon a time, Apple was so concerned about accuracy of floating point
	  operations that they required all operations be performed in IEEE extended
	  (80bit). This had the interesting side effect that a program which conformed
	  to Apple's standards could not also conform to ANSI C (which required operations
	  use double temporaries for double values). I find it somewhat ironic, therefore,
	  that gcc on the mac doesn't even promote floats to doubles. FF needs the
	  extra accuracy provided by a double (an extended type doesn't seem to provide
	  additional assistance unfortunately). So on the mac we got extrema that weren't,
	  which meant that remove overlap didn't.
	<LI>
	  If we had a mac feature which had multiple subtables (ie. a state machine
	  for a contextual substitution, and a non-contextual substitution too) then
	  we produced a bad chain in the morx table.
	<LI>
	  Merge &amp; Simplify would sometimes generate solutions using control points
	  which were diametrically opposed to what they should be.
	<LI>
	  Yet another attempt to do a better job of autohinting.
	<LI>
	  Add a "Revert to Backup" command.
	<LI>
	  Put code in to correct for single bit (sometimes double bit) errors when
	  search from extrema. This is at a lower level than the previous patch.
	<LI>
	  Output of extension lookups wasn't working
	<LI>
	  Fixed a problem in the ttf names pane of Font Info.
	<LI>
	  A slight improvement to magnifying by dragging a rectangle.
	<LI>
	  The first time you click on a transition in a Font Info-&gt;Mac SM-&gt;Indic
	  state machine, ff would crash.
	<LI>
	  Tihkomirov points out that it isn't clear how to delete a ttf name from the
	  name pane of fontinfo. So add some popup help. The language &amp; string
	  ID menus in that pane were sorted on the wrong key
	<LI>
	  Was not preserving (unparsed) tables properly. Several bugs.
	<LI>
	  When loading an apple bitmap font (with no hmtx tables) we need to dummy
	  up widths for the outline glyphs.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      15-Jul-2006
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Apple's bitmap only fonts should not have an 'hhea' nor an 'hmtx' table<BR>
	  Dummy up outline glyph widths when we don't have a 'hmtx' table by looking
	  at bitmap widths for that glyph.<BR>
	  ftxvalidate complains if the vertical line metrics are 0. Even in a strike
	  with no vertical metrics information. So dummy something up.
	<LI>
	  Was getting the flags wrong for turning off features in an apple morx chain.
	<LI>
	  When outputing mark-to-base sub-tables with multiple marks I neglected to
	  output an NUL offsets for the anchors that weren't there. So if a glyph had
	  only one anchor (instead of two, or however many) then the offsets would
	  be all wrong.
	<LI>
	  The SetPref() scripting function was misdocumented to be called SetPrefs()
	  so accept both names.
	<LI>
	  When building an accented letter out of glyphs with an anchor class ff would
	  increase the advance width of the accented glyph by the size (xmax-xmin)
	  of the accent.
	<LI>
	  Expand the functionality of the ruler tool so that it also shows curvature.
	<LI>
	  When importing a bitmap font from a mac binary or an sfnt and the encodings
	  of the destination and the bitmap did not match, then things got rather screwed
	  up and might crash.
	<LI>
	  patch from KANOU. the ref check routine in glyphcomp compared one reference
	  to itself.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      03-Jul-2006
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Type2 charstrings have no closepath operator. I used to think that meant
	  I could not omit the final vector. In fact it means I can omit the final
	  vector AND the closepath operator.
	<LI>
	  If we had a font with no complete code pages we used to generate a version
	  0 OS/2 table without codepage info. But now windows refuses to install such
	  a font. Instead generate a bogus codepage field which claims to have latin1
	  (even though it doesn't).
	  <P>
	  Windows won't use a font where the codepages field is 0.
	<LI>
	  When generating a FOND for a bitmap only sfnt, we created dummy 'NFNT' resources
	  with the wrong resource ids. Which meant we got garbage when the font was
	  used.
	<LI>
	  Make the TabSets in the font &amp; glyph info dialogs run vertically rather
	  than hor izontally. (Add an option to get the old display back).
	<LI>
	  Approximate Spline from Point Slopes sometimes set the control point while
	  leavi ng the nonextcp flag on.
	<LI>
	  Add Extrema only looked at how close a point was to the extrema in one dimension.
	  While that dimension is more important, make a less stringent check on the
	  other.
	<LI>
	  Expand Stroke removes "U-turns" from splines because they confuse it. But
	  the routine that did that got a bit rambunctious and did the wrong thing
	  on a circular arc.
	<LI>
	  If a font did not contain an OS/2 table then we didn't retain the 'hhea'
	  ascent/ descent.
	<LI>
	  Various fixes from Matthias Kilian of OpenBSD.
	<LI>
	  When asking for default 'subs' features, every glyph gets assigned U+2080.
	<LI>
	  Display the curvature information at each point. In Point Info dlg, and in
	  a pop up window when editing cps.
	<LI>
	  Add two new menu commands/scripting commands:
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      Canonical Start Points (CanonicalStart())
	    <LI>
	      Canonical Contours (CanonicalContours())
	  </UL>
	  <P>
	  The first sets the start point of each contour to the leftmost point, while
	  the second orders the contours by their leftmost points. This will slightly
	  reduce the size of output charstrings. It will also make more things available
	  to be put in subroutines.
	<LI>
	  Print Multi-Size &amp; Full Page printed the wrong glyphs from the font view.
	  Broken since the encoding change.
	<LI>
	  When stroking a contour that makes a 180degree turn, ff did not give it a
	  semi-circle if linejoin was set to round.
	<LI>
	  SPLCopyTranslatedHintMasks didn't work if there were more than one contour
	  being copied.
	<LI>
	  Nathan Summers points out that if the XUID is garbage the ff can go into
	  an infinite loop when generating an otf/cff font.
	<LI>
	  Somehow the XUID and UniqueID fields crept off the bottom of the fontinfo
	  Names p ane and weren't visible or modifyable. Give them their own pane now.
	<LI>
	  Apply some patches (with some changes) from Nathan Summers to the truetype
	  debugger.
	<LI>
	  The property count in BDF fonts is wrong.
	<LI>
	  Ralf Stubner points out that the notdef glyph in an otf font should look
	  like that in a ttf font, and not like that in a type1 font. (that is there
	  should be something in the glyph).
	<LI>
	  Add support for group "encodings" which have empty spaces for unused glyphs.
	<LI>
	  make another attempt to find a good default sli for glyphs with no default
	  script.
	<LI>
	  Typo in scripting function DefaultATT.
	<LI>
	  The View-&gt;Display Substitutions has been broken since the encoding change
	  last summer.
	<LI>
	  Mark glyphs with out of date instructions differently from those with no
	  instructions.
	<LI>
	  The last change to the cvt table generally did not get made.
	<LI>
	  Make glyph compare check for point matching in anchor points and in references.
	<LI>
	  Add a warning message about out of date instructions when generating a font.
	<LI>
	  When generating a font with anchor points matched to ttf points, ff failed
	  to allocate enough space for them and offsets got all confused.
	<LI>
	  Oops. Some variables which should have been static were dynamic. Which meant
	  we kept dlopening libfreetype.
	<LI>
	  If we had an anchor point which positioned itself with point matching, and
	  we ge nerated an otf font then we'd output a lookup which tried to do point
	  matching i n postscript. Only do point matching if we are sure we're in a
	  tt font.
	<LI>
	  Add a preference item to control clearing of tt instructions.
	<LI>
	  Printing a multi-size page of a truetype font crashed.
	<LI>
	  Anchor Point dlg didn't work well with matching tt points.
	<LI>
	  Add a field to allow users to search for a glyph name within a kerning class.
	<LI>
	  Interesting. In kerning by classes, if the coverage table does not match
	  the glyphs specified in all the classes (for the first (left) glyph), then
	  any glyphs in the coverage table but not in any class should be treated as
	  being in class 0.
	<LI>
	  Add something to the font view's copy from menu to control whether truetype
	  instructions are copied or not.
	<LI>
	  Add some more problems to find problems
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      Check for glyphs with both contours and references.
	    <LI>
	      Find out of date point matched references.
	    <LI>
	      Find references with transformation matrices which can't be expressed (as
	      refs) in truetype
	    <LI>
	      Find references with transformation matrices which aren't translations (and
	      so can't be expressed (as refs) in type1/2 fonts.

	<LI>
	  Johan Winge also points out that I identify points as tangents when they
	  should not be. This is because I use one measure of sloppiness no matter

	  If the user has never called PrintSetup (or if the user has not called PrintSetup

	  on a pagesize which will fit on either A4 or US-Letter. The PS manual says
	  a printer should refuse such a size unless it has paper within 5 points of
	  it. So on printers which follow the spec (not mine) nothing will print as
	  it waits for paper.

	<LI>
	  when outputting bdf, fnt or pt3 bitmap fonts with no outline font generated,
	  we'd get filenames like foo-*-13.bdf. Get rid of the "-*".
	<LI>
	  Support point numbering of composites even when not debugging.
	<LI>
	  Michal Nowakowski points out that the cvt editor crashed if we changed the
	  length of the table.
	<LI>
	  Provide two new scripting functions:
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      MoveReference(xoff,yoff,[ref-name/ref-unicode]+)
	    <LI>
	      PositionReference(x,y,[ref-name/ref-unicode]+)
	  </UL>
	  <P>
	  These search all selected glyphs, looking for any references in those glyphs
	  with the given name/unicode value, and then translating the reference by
	  (xoff,yoff) or positioning the reference absolutely at (x,y).
	<LI>
	  ff failed to read horizontal metrics properly from a type2 CFF CID font.
	  In most cases this would be masked by the fact that ff would correct the
	  bad width values by reading the hmtx table. But if one had a bare CFF font,
	  or a 'gai' font where there is no external source of widths, ff would get
	  things wrong.
	<LI>
	  Alexej Kryukov points out that most entries in the private dict should be
	  scaled when we do a ScaleToEm.
	<LI>
	  Fix a couple of problems with cid font display that "gai" fonts expose.
	<LI>
	  Michal Nowakowski points out that I generated truetype instructions --- and
	  then forgot to attach them to the glyph. Whoops.
	<LI>
	  Loading extensible glyph information from a tfm file was broken by the encoding
	  change.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      19-Sept-2005
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  ff did not read AAT classes (kerning classes, etc) properly. It read one
	  extra element which could cause problems
	<LI>
	  Cleanup svg output for kerning classes with no members.
	<LI>
	  Out of bounds array reference in OS2FigureCodePages caused a crash on the
	  mac.
	<LI>
	  When loading a type1 font we failed to set the unicode encoding on seac
	  references. This probably broke lots of things, it certainly broke replace
	  with reference.
	<LI>
	  Add a DefaultRoundToGrid scripting function to set the Round-to-Grid truetype
	  reference bit (basically set it whenever we have a reference which isn't
	  point matched).
	<LI>
	  Add support for truetype point matching in references and anchor points
	<LI>
	  Improve the debugging heuristic that notices when we've jumpped to a new
	  routine to work better with composites
	<LI>
	  If I attempted to debug a glyph with no instructions there was a race condition
	  and if the race was won one way, ff would hang.
	<LI>
	  We weren't numbering points in a composite. This was only obvious when we
	  did a View-&gt;Show Grid Fit on a composite glyph.
	<LI>
	  When debugging a composite glyph, ff forgot that some references are translated
	  (or scaled or rotated), and failed to display this.
	<LI>
	  FF failed to keep track of the truetype "RoundToGrid" bit which applies to
	  references.
	<LI>
	  In the Points window of truetype debugging, if the penultimate point of a
	  contour was interpolated, then the contour boundary was drawn in the wrong
	  place.
	<LI>
	  Use to store debugging dpi/pointsize in the charview. Werner suggests that
	  it be global (so different glyphs will all share the same defaults).
	<LI>
	  Some Unicode code blocks have moved (probably those which only in the pipeline
	  or some such), and some others have been added to the pipeline.

      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Can't use a subroutine to refer to a translated glyph which contains flex
	  hints in type1 output.
	<LI>
	  Hide another problem with rounding errors in remove overlap.
	<LI>
	  Don't produce multiple warnings about the local encoding.
	<LI>
	  In quadratic fonts the Remove Overlap menu item is disabled, but if you use
	  the hotkey the command is invoked (with disasterous results).
	<LI>
	  Typo in point info code to determine whether a hint mask contains conflicts
	  (matched vertical hints against horizontal ones)
      </UL>
    <LI>
      12-Sept-2005
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Added a scripting command DefaultUseMyMetrics() to set the use_my_metrics
	  bit in old fonts.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      11-Sept-2005
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  &nbsp;&nbsp; When ff pastes refs from one font to another it tries to figure
	  out the width of a glyph containing references from the width of what appears
	  to be the base glyph. (because if you paste Aacute from one font to another,
	  the size of the "A" glyph may be quite different in the new font. Using the
	  width of the glyph in the original font would be wrong).
	  <P>
	  There are two problems with this:
	  <OL>
	    <LI>
	      It didn't take forward references into account, and would use the original
	      width rather than the modified width of the reference.
	    <LI>
	      It would (probably) be confused by an Alphatonos where the width of Alphatonos
	      is not the same as that of Alpha.
	  </OL>
	  <P>
	  instead figure widths out after all pastes have completed, looking at the
	  use_my_metrics bit to get things right.
	<LI>
	  Handle forward references to glyphs which will be pasted into by the current
	  command (used to work, broken by the encoding change)
	<LI>
	  Various fixes for pasting references from a font which has since been closed.
	<LI>
	  Support the ttf "_USE_MY_METRICS" bit on composite glyphs. This entails:
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      Retaining it when reading a truetype font
	    <LI>
	      Setting properly when generating one
	    <LI>
	      Storing it in sfd files
	    <LI>
	      Giving the user a way to set it with the Element-&gt;GetInfo command

	  ff crashed when given a bdf font with multiple glyphs with the same name
	<LI>
	  Try to avoid generating bdf fonts with multiple glyphs with the same name.
	  This happened when a single glyph was mapped to several encodings, a concept
	  bdf doesn't support. Now when it looks like this will happen we rename the
	  glyph.
	<LI>
	  Uninitialized variable in dependant sub-menu (broken by encoding change)
	<LI>
	  Pasting a reference into a font which did not contain the referred glyph
	  did not give you the option of copying the original outlines any more. (broken
	  by the encoding change)
	<LI>
	  Merging fonts where glyphs had multiple encodings caused crashes.
	<LI>
	  I'm very old fashioned. I like having error messages on stderr. But far too
	  many people don't see them there. I guess they invoke fontforge directly
	  from X with stderr directed to some invisible console window. Well create
	  a little window to contain warning messages about font errors (for instance
	  when reading an otf font we might complain about glyphs out of bounds, etc.)
	<LI>
	  Add support for postscript bitmap fonts. This means:
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      Ability to parse (simple forms of) the imagemask ps operator
	    <LI>
	      Code to detect that a type3 is a ps bitmap, and convert it into a normal
	      bitmap font that people can edit.
	    <LI>
	      Bitmap output as a ps type3 font (using imagemask)
	    <LI>
	      Fixing a bug in my output routines which worked fine for images in eps files,
	      but failed horribly if that same code was stuffed into a charproc and executed
	      on demand.
	  </UL>
	<LI>
	<LI>
	  ff could not handle an encoding specified as a simple array. (Not allowed
	  in typ e1 spec, but obvious for a type3)
	<LI>
	  And ff's handling of any type3s was broken by the encoding patch.
	<LI>
	  If a font contained fewer than 256 glyphs, then ff failed to load a format0
	  cmap subtable properly.
      </UL>

	<LI>
	  In fontinfo, changed the tab "TTF Values" to be "OS/2", consolidated the
	  Panose tab underneath it. Added many more fields, almost all of OS/2.
	<LI>
	  Fixed a number of uninitialized variables, at the instigation of Pavel Roskin.
	<LI>
	  Applied several patches from Pavel Roskin.
	<LI>
	  The scripting WorthOutputting command insisted on an argument, even when
	  it should not have.
	<LI>
	  Scripting SetCharCnt command has been broken since the encoding change.
