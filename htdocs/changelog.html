	<LI>
	  New Russian translation of the UI
      </UL>
    <LI>
      29-Apr-2008
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Validate didn't work in CID keyed fonts.
	<LI>
	  Pierre Hanser wants an X Resource (fontforge.CharView.Rulers.FontSize) to
	  specify the font size of text displayed in the info line and the rulers.
	  I have applied his patch, but have made no effort to insure that text will
	  fit in the space allowed for it.
	<LI>
	  Hmm. Freetype seems to dislike rasterizing some complex outlines at large
	  pixelsizes in black and white, but seems fine with doing them in greyscale.
	<LI>
	  When opening a ttc file (and posting a dlg which lists all the fonts in the
	  file) try to find a fontname in the current locale. We used to look first
	  for English and then anything. Now try: First current locale, then english,
	  then anything.
	<LI>
	  Make the Open Font dlg (and similar file chooser dlgs) be customizable, and
	  store that info in prefs. Specifically control whether directories are displayed
	  in alphabetical order among other files, before normal files, or in a separate
	  pane.
	  <P>
	  Also add a bookmark (and back/forward) mechanism.
	<LI>
	  Add support for opening a font from http &amp; ftp URLs. Can browse ftp URLs,
	  and save fonts back to ftp.<BR>
	  <CODE>$ fontforge
	  http://openfontlibrary.org/people/Nasenbaer/Nasenbaer_-_Widelands.ttf</CODE>
	<LI>
	  The validation patch broke the save mac family dialog, and then the upload
	  to open font library broke it further.
	<LI>
	  When doing expand stroke, it is possible to have two points so close together
	  that there is no data on the curve in between the two. If this happens
	  ApproximateFromPointsSlopes can't do a good job. So be careful of this case.
	<LI>
	  Layers change introduced a potential crash in the Embolden command.
	<LI>
	  fontimage didn't draw the first line.<BR>
	  Add a cgi front end to <A HREF="fontimage.html">fontimage</A> so now
	  it is possible to get a font sample of any font on my website.
	<LI>
	  In the Display dlg, if you changed the font, or the point size without selecting
	  something, then that change would vanish instantly. Fix that.
	  <P>
	  Also, was a crash bug when mixing a font with a baseline table and a font
	  without one (in the disply dlg).
	<LI>
	  Add a command to insert text into a glyph. (<CODE>Element-&gt;Insert Text
	  Outlines)</CODE> It adds the text outlines directly (instead of a draw command
	  using another font) because most fonts can't include text drawing in their
	  glyphs. Also include a Bind to Path variant.
	<LI>
	  GLyph lists in kerning classes (in show att) were displayed as ligatures.
	<LI>
	  Upgrade to unicode 5.1
	<LI>
	  If an sfd file were saved with spiros active, and then loaded into a version
	  of fontforge without libspiro, then bad things would happen. Whenever we
	  check that spiros are active also check that they can be active, and add
	  some warnings for the user to let him/her know that spiros aren't available.
	<LI>
	  Add a tile pattern command (if --enable-tile-path) this allows the user to
	  replicate any given pattern in another glyph.
	  <P>
	  This could be used to produce a grid of guidelines, or, in conjunction with
	  <CODE>Element-&gt;Overlap-&gt;Intersec</CODE>t it could provide a poor man's
	  "Pattern Fill" (Since Pattern fills are only available in type3 fonts this
	  sort of makes them work for any font type).
      </UL>
    <LI>
      30-Mar-2008
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Add support for the OpenType 'BASE' table, and to a lesser extent for Apple's
	  'bsln' table.
	  <P>
	  Add python scripting (font.horizontalBaseline, font.verticalBaseline) too.
	  <P>
	  Add support under Show ATT.
	  <P>
	  Remove the old vertical origin field.
	<LI>
	  Add the ability to create a dummy 'DSIG' table (one containing no signatures)
	  so that Windows will show an opentype icon for a font with extension 'ttf'
	<LI>
	  Add support for gradient and pattern fills to type3 fonts (only if
	  <CODE>./configure --enable-type3</CODE> is specified, of course.
	  <P>
	  Also add support for cliping paths
	  <P>
	  Make fonts containing images work in pdf output.
	<LI>
	  Bump the sfd version number. This should have happened in the last release,
	  but I didn't realize it was needed then, thus there will be sfd files with
	  an incorrect version number (2) when it should be 3. However that should
	  not cause the current parser problems.
	<LI>
	  New Greek translation from Apostolos
	<LI>
	  Updated Polish translation from Michal
	<LI>
	  Apostolos points out that compiling on systems without freetype (Solaris
	  boxes) was broken after last months layers patch.
	<LI>
	  Werner suggested various improvements to Show ATT:
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      Lookups should be sorted
	    <LI>
	      Glyph images should be drawn in more cases (before, just for substitutions)
	  </UL>
	<LI>
	  Patch from Alexey, for better handling conflicts between diagonal and H/V
	  stems.
	<LI>
	  Do a more consistent job of handlong curved stem segments. Also collect point
	  data for off-curve points too (may be useful in future for TTF hinting).
	<LI>
	  Last month I put in a patch to make sure the lsb as stored in the 'hmtx'
	  table was really the glyph's lsb if bit 1 of the head.flags field were set.
	  Unfortunately I read in the lsb as an unsigned number which shifted negative
	  lsbs off to around 65535. FF sometimes refused to rasterize them. Of course
	  when the font was generated they got truncated back to negatives in the output.
	<LI>
	  Add a preference item so that fonts will be automagically compacted when
	  they are opened.
	<LI>
	  Add a new preference item (SeekCharacter) to allow users to control which
	  character will be displayed when opening a new font. Normally FontForge displays
	  'A', but that's a bit latin-alphabet-centric.
	<LI>
	  If palettes were not docked, the a complicated series of events could lead
	  to a crash after closing a TilePath (Math kerning, Gradient Fill, etc.) dialog.
	<LI>
	  Was not outputting the %%LanguageLevel DSC comment.
	<LI>
	  Generating a CID-keyed otf font was broken by the layers patch. (Only the
	  background layer was output).
	<LI>
	  Encoding-&gt;Add Encoding Slots didn't work for CID-keyed fonts.
	<LI>
	  Autoinstructor does more consistent vertical stem placement for mono and
	  grayscale. Advance width scales much better. One downside: letters tend to
	  'glue' at small ppems.
	<LI>
	  When FF read in a pairwise positioning lookup with no change to the pos of
	  the first glyph, and an x change to the second glyph it treated that as a
	  r2l kern pair even if the lookup was l2r. This lead to problems.
	<LI>
	  In the Print/Display window all vertical GPOS positioning was diametrically
	  opposed to the direction it should have gone (there was a sign error).
	<LI>
	  Print managed to break itself somehow. Print of a font display to ps file
	  (or was it pdf) didn't work. Type3 pdf fonts were broken, last glyph omitted.
	<LI>
	  In the fontview the horizontal advance and baseline metrics lines were drawn
	  as if bitmap magnification were 1 (so if bitmap mag&gt;1 they were in the
	  wrong place).
	<LI>
	  In the char view, when the active tool is the scale tool, show the scale
	  factors on the info line.
	<LI>
	  The default set for control points of a corner point before/after an hv curve
	  point was to have no control point. Make it be the same as a normal curve.
	<LI>
	  layers patch broke type3 editing in that: in a type3 font glyphs don't have
	  the same number of layers so it is possible to move from one glyph to another
	  in the char view and have the current layer become invalid.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      9-Mar-2008
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Undefined value in the martlett patch.
	<LI>
	  A variable was placed on the stack in font info which needed a longer lifetime.
	  This would probably mean that after several remetrickings of that window
	  the jump to OS/2 Unicode ranges in the Unicode ranges pane would appear in
	  a strange color and oddly shaped. I never saw it happen, but it should have.
	  The variable is now static.
	<LI>
	  When ff read in a contextual subs by glyphs it would reorder each glyph list
	  (backtrack, lookahead and normal) so that the glyphs were in GID order. So
	  "a b c" would probably come out fine in the lookahead list, but would be
	  reversed in the backtrack, while "c b a" would be reversed in the lookahead).
	  Ug.
	<LI>
	  The code which decided on whether to apply a chaining lookup approached backtrack
	  data in the wrong order (so only lookups with either 0 or 1 backtrack entries
	  worked. Which was all I used to test).
	<LI>
	  New fonts were created with relative filenames, this screwed up some font
	  searches. Make 'em absolute.
	<LI>
	  Deleting something in the guidelines layer probably caused a crash.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      2-Mar-2008
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  <B><BIG>Layers</BIG></B>
	  <P>
	  The big change in this release is that every font database can now contain
	  multiple layers. Before this all layers in a font used the same type of splines
	  and there were only 2 or 3 of them.
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      Guideline semi-layer -- where all the glyphs of the font shared the same
	      set of outlines, to which points would snap if desired.
	    <LI>
	      A background layer -- which could contain outlines and also images which
	      could be autotraced into the foreground layer.
	    <LI>
	      A foreground layer -- which was what the font really looked like, and what
	      went into generated fonts
	  </UL>
	  <P>
	  Now there may be any number of layers, and each layer can contain different
	  types of splines -- so one database can contain both quadratic and cubic
	  data and can store data for both PostScript and TrueType fonts.
	  <P>
	  In a normal font all glyphs have the same number of layers (this is not true
	  in a type3 font, which each glyph may have it's own set of layers). You may
	  set the number, names and types of layers width the <CODE>Element-&gt;Font
	  Info-&gt;Layers</CODE> pane.
	  <P>
	  In the font view you can select which layer is active (and displayed) with
	  the <CODE>View-&gt;Layers</CODE> menu item. You can copy selected glyphs
	  of one layer to another (automagically adjusting the spline type if needed)
	  with <CODE>Edit-&gt;Copy Layer To Layer</CODE>. You can compare to layers
	  for differences with <CODE>Element-&gt;Compare Layers...</CODE>.
	  <P>
	  In the character view the Layers palette has changed. The things which controlled
	  the visibility of hints have moved to the <CODE>View-&gt;Show</CODE> menu
	  (as have some other entries that used to be in the top level
	  <CODE>View</CODE> menu). The layers palette solely displays the glyph's layers
	  and controls which layer is active.
	  <P>
	  The <CODE>File-&gt;Generate Fonts...</CODE> dialog allows you to specify
	  which layer is to go into the font. Note that many things remain common:
	  the hints and truetype instructions apply to all layers. GPOS, GSUB, kern,
	  and morx information is common all layers. The outlines may differ in detail,
	  but outlines from which a font will be generated should have the same shape.
	  <P>
	  Add new python stuff to handle layers:
	  <DL>
	    <DT>
	      fontforge.activeLayer()
	    <DD>
	      Returns the currently active layer
	    <DT>
	      font.layer_cnt
	    <DD>
	      Returns the number of layers in the font
	    <DT>
	      font.layers
	    <DD>
	      A dictionary like object which can be indexed either by an integer between
	      0 (inclusive) and layer_cnt (exclusive) or by the name of a layer. After
	      indexing it returns a LayerInfo object. LayerInfo objects have no independant
	      existance, and contain a layer's name and a boolean indicating whether the
	      layer is_quadratic.
	      <BLOCKQUOTE>
		<PRE>font.layers[1].name = "Foreground"
font.layers[0].is_quadratic = TRUE
</PRE>
	      </BLOCKQUOTE>
	      <DL>
		<DT>
		  You may delete a layer
		<DD>
		  <CODE>del font.layers["Extra layer"]</CODE>
		<DT>
		  You may add a new layer
		<DD>
		  <CODE>font.layers.add("name",is_quadratic)</CODE>
	      </DL>
	      <P>
	      (this object has an iterator which returns the names of all layers)
	    <DT>
	      glyph.layer_cnt
	    <DD>
	      Returns the number of layers in the glyph (this is the same as the number
	      in the font, except for type3 fonts).
	    <DT>
	      glyph.layers
	    <DD>
	      Returns a dictionary like object which may be indexed by layer name or an
	      integer [0,layer_cnt) as above. The result is a standard layer object. (this
	      object has an iterator which returns the names of all layers)
	    <DT>
	      glyph.reflayers
	    <DD>
	      Returns a dictionary like object which may be indexed by layer name or an
	      integer [0,layer_cnt) as above. The result is a standard list of references.
	      (this object has an iterator which returns the names of all layers)
	    <DT>
	      layer.export
	    <DD>
	      It is now possible to export the contours of a layer (before only glyphs
	      could be exported)
	    <DT>
	      glyph.export
	    <DD>
	      Slight change to the semantics. When outputting an outline file, there is
	      now an optional second argument which specifies the layer to output. (again
	      integer or layer name).
	    <DT>
	      font.generate
	    <DD>
	      Has a new keyword argument "layer" to specify which layer should be output.
	  </DL>
	<LI>
	  M.P. Suzuki requests a way to load the entire 'glyf' table of a ttc. Actually
	  he would like to load all 'glyf' tables of a ttc, but that would cause all
	  kinds of problems (multiple fpgm, prep, maxp, cvt tables, trying to fix up
	  GIDs in GPOS/GSUB/kern/* tables, dealing with fonts with so many glyphs they
	  could not be generated, ...)
	  <P>
	  So the command line now takes an --allglyphs argument, and the scripting
	  open commands now take a value of 4 for the openflags argument to mean this.
	<LI>
	  Add a command Points-&gt;Make Arc, which is similar to Points-&gt;Make Line
	  except that it connects the two points with an elliptical arc rather than
	  a straight line. The ellipse is choosen to run through the two points (obviously)
	  and to be tangent to the slope of those points. This isn't enough information
	  to determine an ellipse uniquely (three points and two tangents being required)
	  so in general there will be an infinite number of solutions (and it is possible
	  to provide contradictory input so that no ellipse can be found). FontForge
	  may not choose the ellipse you had your heart set on. FF will first attempt
	  to find an ellipse so that one of the points lies on an axis of the ellipse
	  (this will find a circle if there is a circle which satisfies the constraints
	  above). If that fails it will look more generally for ellipses.
	  <P>
	  (If you hold down the &lt;Alt&gt; key when you select the menu item, FF will
	  leave the ellipse it calculated in the background layer. That was a debugging
	  technique but I thought it was kind of interesting and left it in.)
	<LI>
	  Further improvements in calculating active zones for curved segments for
	  autohinging: if the spline is closer to the opposed stem edge at the given
	  point, don't extend the active zone any longer.
	  <P>
	  If a line's unit vector is close enough to the font's italic slant, then
	  prefer the unit vector based on the italic slant instead.
	  <P>
	  Added an experimental mode which allows to build glyph data based on a
	  preexisting hint layout and extend it with additional stems.
	<LI>
	  The rotate tool in char view didn't show the angle of rotation.
	<LI>
	  Fixed various uninitialized values
	<LI>
	  Make sure the first character in marlett is 0xf020.
	<LI>
	  Reinstate the behavior of the symbol encoding that the wine developers depend
	  on.
	<LI>
	  Add a scripting flag so that script writers can control whether a font has
	  a symbol encoding without having to use a funky extension. (Wine people don't
	  like having to say ".sym.ttf").
	<LI>
	  When building a ligature, ff would mark the first letter with use_my_metrics.
	  That should only happen when building accented glyphs.
	<LI>
	  Put in a way for the user to leap easily from Font Info-&gt;Unicode Ranges
	  to Font Info-&gt;OS/2-&gt;Charsets-&gt;Unicode Ranges.
	<LI>
	  python scripting font.sfnt_names would sometimes crash.
	<LI>
	  When a matrixedit is initialized its last visible column (especially if followed
	  by hidden columns) may not be at the edge of the matrixedit. This lead to
	  drawing spurious lines which annoyed Alexej.
	<LI>
	  When running simplify on a quadratic contour and the contour doubles back
	  on itself, FF would do an optimization which only worked for cubics.
	<LI>
	  Werner tells me that if bit 1 of the 'head'.flags field is clear then I should
	  adjust so that the left side bearing is what is specified in the 'hmtx' table.
	<LI>
	  Pdf filter decode didn't work if given an array of filters (not even in the
	  array contain only a single filter).
	<LI>
	  FontForge doesn't support pdf encryption which seems to require a license
	  from RSA. Before we'd just announce failure for no reason, now announce that
	  the file is encrypted and we can't read it.
	<LI>
	  Improper test for point matching in references (in tt).
	<LI>
	  In an un instructed font, the [Default] button in FontInfo-&gt;Grid Fitting
	  produces the wrong result (and has since I added support for the new gasp
	  features of ClearType.
	<LI>
	  Doing hint modifications caused errant pointers to be used. Often crashing.
	<LI>
	  Math strings weren't getting initialized in math kern.
	<LI>
	  One of the math constants had the wrong friendly name.
	<LI>
	  Michal points out that tooltips in the math window don't get translated.
	<LI>
	  TopLeft/TopRight etc. in math kerning weren't translated.
	<LI>
	  The transform menu item seems to have lost its shortcut. Put it back.
	<LI>
	  When selecting a control point in the outline view, we would always select
	  the next point if both next and prev were in the same place (ie, on the base
	  point itself). But when the point is at the end of an open contour, the one
	  which should be selected is the one which controls a spline (which need not
	  be the next one).
	<LI>
	  Oh dear. My original method for storing background layers didn't allow for
	  references (because I didn't put them in the background). But I need them
	  now.
	<LI>
	  Label some of the horizontal metrics lines
	<LI>
	  Trying to move the top accent line resulted in a crash.
	<LI>
	  Drat. FF really wants to set the latin1 codepage bit, even if the user explicitly
	  provides the codepage settings. The wine people don't like that.
	<LI>
	  If we have two fonts open, a type3 (multilayered) one and a normal outline,
	  and we have outline glyph windows open from each font, and we move the focus
	  between the glyph windows, then the layers palette will get left behind when
	  focus moves to the other font. (and other more complex senarios when switching
	  between multilayered and outline).
	<LI>
	  When loading a feature file, ff would complain if a mark appeared in two
	  anchor classes -- even if those classes were in separate lookups. This meant
	  it got unhappy about a mark which was in both a mark 2 mark lookup and in
	  a mark to base lookup.
	<LI>
	  I had intended not to give warning messages about names like "nine.oldstyle"
	  (defined in Adobe's obsolete PUA mapping) when loading a tt font, if such
	  a glyph had a different unicode mapping (or none) than the one Adobe used
	  ages ago. But I screwed up and was generating messages anyway.
	<LI>
	  When converting cubics to quadratics, if we had a curved spline where one
	  of the endpoints of the spline had no control point, then we'd get a slope
	  at that point of 0/0. This meant that we tried to put a quadratic control
	  point on top of that endpoint which looked confusing and seemed unnecessary.
	<LI>
	  Typo in glyph compare. Caused another crash when comparing lookups.
	<LI>
	  Didn't handle NULL tokens properly when reading in a feature file.
	<LI>
	  Make it easier to select control points when the alt key is down.
	<LI>
	  Add a mechanism for getting default values for private dict entries in python
	  scripts.
	  <P>
	  (Also provide default values now when [Add]ing private entries in Font Info.
	<LI>
	  Making class0 editable broke the ability to create a context chaining class
	  lookup.
	<LI>
	  The encapsulation for creating libfontforge broke importing a lookup from
	  one font to another.
	<LI>
	  Feature file generation omitted a semicolon after (some) contextual lookup
	  rules.
	<LI>
	  Nasty bug with references in ApplySubstitutions scripting command.
	<LI>
	  Mark classes didn't work.
	<LI>
	  Michal N. points out that "Really Use Typo Metrics" should be moved above
	  the typo metrics (or below) but should not be in the middle of them.
	  <P>
	  He also tells me that the internationalized weight classes don't get parsed
	  properly.
	<LI>
	  Someone handed me a font with a SJIS encoding cmap. The cmap mapped a glyph
	  to SJIS 128, which isn't a valid SJIS code point. FF got an insane result
	  when trying to convert to unicode and crashed. Add a check against bad code
	  points.
	<LI>
	  Add two proposed features from the pre-draft of OT 1.6
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      Drop Caps
	    <LI>
	      Character Variants 00-99

	<LI>
	  Werner wants to be able to select text in the warnings window to paste elsewhere.

	  FontForge uses floats (which have ~24 bits of precision internally) to represent

	  during output and input of a font. Unfortunately, due to the rel-rel nature
	  of postscript these slight errors accumulate.
	  <P>
	  So instead, when loading and saving a Type2 font use double precision

	  will be slight errors when converted to SplinePoints, but these errors will

	  It used to be that when a font had both 'mor[tx]' and 'GSUB' we would only
	  read 'GSUB'. But Michel Boyer wanted to read both. So... read 'morx' after
	  'GSUB' and if we find a feature/setting that looks as though it corresponds
	  to an existing OpenType lookup (which we can convert to a Mac format) then
	  skip that feature/setting, presuming it to contain redundant data.
	  <P>
	  This is a finer grain approach, but similar to, the previous one. There we
	  skipped the whole table, presuming it redundant. But in CharisSIL the morx
	  table has a lot of functionality orthogonal to GSUB. So we must parse both.

	  It expected to find spiros in a glyph marked as being edited in spiro mode,
	  and was surprised when none were available.

	  Dave Crossland doesn't like having "..." at the end of window titles.

	  Back out the Add Extrema in spiro mode patch. Turn off display of extrema
	  in spiro mode (and of Points of Inflection too).

	  Add an autowidth command to the python interface.

	  contour.lineTo and friends didn't work (didn't increment the contour's point
	  count).

	  With SnapToInt preference on, and at high magnifications, a mouse click would
	  often be snapped so that it was well outside the fudge region. This meant
	  that clicking on something might not select it.

	      the old mechanism for referencing a resource fork from POSIX "foo/rsrc" has
	      changed to "foo/..namedfork/rsrc".

	  <P>
	  The new stuff all worked as far back as 10.3 -- but FontForge source is no
	  longer compatible with 10.2.
	<LI>
	  In a truetype font, if a substitution lead to an unencoded glyph and the
	  cursor hung over the substitution long enough to invoke the popup, then we'd
	  generate a tiny font containing just the unencoded glyph, we'd complain that
	  there were no encoded glyphs, we'd dismiss the popup, we'd generate the glyph
	  image, then we'd try to free it with no free function because the popup was
	  dismissed.
	<LI>
	  Merge Feature File didn't actually merge things in, it forgot about existing
	  things -- which caused problems for kerning classes which get stored in two
	  lists.
	<LI>
	  Allow people to order entries in the PostScript Private dictionary (in Font
	  Info)
	<LI>
	  Give the user control over how much arrow keys accelerate when holding down
	  the Alt (Meta) key.
	<LI>
	  People want a Snap To Int preference item.
	<LI>
	  Simplify sometimes ignored points.
	<LI>
	  People expect to be able to drag guidelines from the rulers (because everyone
	  else does that) and don't want to bother to learn FF's mechanism. So make
	  that possible.
	<LI>
	  Dave C wants to be able to use Cntl-Tab to switch tabs in the charview.
	<LI>
	  If freetype gets a single point open contour in postscript mode, it simply
	  skips the contour (does not call FT_MoveTo on it). This screwed up my attempt
	  to match the results of freetype with the actual splines and caused a crash.
	<LI>
	  Glyphs with no contours didn't set widthset when read from ufo and so were
	  viewed as empty.

	  FF was expecting descent to be a postive value in a ufo (it is in
	  ArialBlack.ufo), but it seems to be negative in most UFOs.

	  Erik wants the creation order of contours preserved when reading a glif file.
	<LI>
	  Oops. glyph/glyphPen types got the wrong names in the fontforge python module.
	  (interchanged)
	<LI>
	  remove the Elide command. (There's no reason to use it, Merge is always better,
	  it just confused people.
	<LI>
	  Refrain from simplifying an order2 point where the second derivative changes
	  sign.

	  If a font has no "fullname" field (and fonts aren't required to have one)
	  ff would crash when generating the font.

	  Ability to Import/Export Raph Levien's plate file format.

	  If I moved a corner point adjacent to a tangent, the slope on the other side
	  of the tangent did not change.

	  Exporting a glyph to BMP or PNG was broken, probably since the addition of
	  python import export filters.
	<LI>
	  Add a Strftime scripting command to the legacy language.

	  Werner points out that I misspelled "persistent" as "persistant" in many
	  places, including python member names. Correct that. (but leave the old,
	  misspelled membernames around but undocumented in case anyone has been mislead
	  by my previous documentation.
	<LI>
	  Add new python stuff to provide access to spiros.<BR>
	  The fontforge module has a new method -- hasSpiro() which returns whether
	  we've got access to libspiro or not.<BR>
	  The module also has a bunch of numeric constants defined spiroG4, spiroG2,
	  etc. for use in the<BR>
	  The Contour type has a new member -- spiros which is a tuple of spiro control
	  points (which are themselves tuples: x,y,type,flags, where type is one of
	  the numeric constants above.

	  People would complain that the python interface would give them "Invalid
	  second order spline" but no one bothered to give me a test case. I hope I've
	  tracked it down now.
	<LI>
	  Add a "problem" to check for glyphs whose bounding boxes are: too tall, too
	  short, too wide, too much to the left.
	<LI>
	  Used to be I had many problems checked by default. Best to turn them all
	  off.

	  Oops. FF was using Py_BuildValue("s") on something that was already a python
	  string.
	<LI>
	  Adam Twardoch suggests that codepoints in the PUA have their script determined
	  by their name (rather than just returning DFLT). Since Adobe used to put

	  FF marked almost all fonts with the Oblique bit in the OS/2 table.

	  - Patch from Alexej for his diagonal hinting routines, fixes an ugly problem
	  reported by Max Rabin.
	<LI>
	  Various fixes in stem detection. In particular added a concept of "base start"
	  and "base end" for curved segments of stem edges, allowing to determine more
	  precisely if an active zone (which merges left and right segments together)
	  should actually be considered "curved" at its

	  Make implied points to be ignored when determining a diagonal stem validity.

	  Swith the timestamps to GMT. Prior to this all timestamps have been PS/DT,
	  but now that other people are making source changes GMT seems more sensible.

	  Max Rabkin supplies a patch to let python import plate files.
	<LI>
	  A couple of new name table string ids: WWS Family &amp; WWS Subfamily.<BR>
	  Provide reasonable defaults for the wws* ttf names.
	<LI>
	  Correct the list of dutch font styles.
	<LI>
	  Most of the items in the popup menu of the lookup pane didn't work.
	<LI>
	  FF wasn't loading python init files from ~/.FontForge/python
	<LI>
	  When I fixed mark to ligature positioning I broke the other three types of
	  anchor positioning (to base, to mark &amp; cursive).
	<LI>
	  If you pressed the [*] Default check box in the Font
	  Info-&gt;OS/2-&gt;Panose area, the values didn't go back to the defaults.
	<LI>
	  When copying glyphs from one font to another ff would sometimes use a temporary
	  value of -2 for the orig_pos. This meant that reference fixups didn't work
	  when looking at those glyphs.
	<LI>
	  Drat. Typo when copying a contextual lookup from one font to another caused
	  a crash.
	<LI>
	  Add a new point tool which creates curved points which are always either
	  horizontally or vertically oriented. (I call 'em hvcurves)

	  Use ~/.FontForge instead of ~/.PfaEdit

	  I'm told there was a typo in my Bulgarian text for the Print/Display dlg,
	  and that this should fix it.

	  Get some proper Belorussian text.
	<LI>
	  Several bugs in my mark attachment routines. There was an assumption that
	  only one mark could be attached to a base glyph per sub-table. This is wrong
	  for mark to base, in that there can be several anchor classes per subtable.
	  It is even worse for mark to ligature where there can be many marks per anchor
	  class (one per ligature position).
	<LI>
	  Having done this make sure we don't use the same anchor point more than once.
	<LI>
	  What glyph class should be used by default if a glyph is both a ligature
	  and a mark? Probably mark. There are greek accent ligatures, and its probably
	  more important to treat them as marks than as ligatures (I don't know any
	  fonts which actually "skip ligatures" but there are lots which "skip marks").
	<LI>
	  Select-&gt;Next/Prev Point always selected the first point. Select First
	  point did the wrong thing.
	<LI>
	  Pressing the [Refresh] button could crash ff if a "FontData" depended on
	  another (same font).

	  Someone (John ?Morrison?) requested a way to access fonts by numeric index
	  rather than font name when opening font collections like ttc files or dfonts.
	<LI>
	  * I no longer have separate l/lpotential and r/rpotential pairs &Acirc;&nbsp;
	  of point data objects. Instead I use just 'l' and 'r' accompanied by
	  &Acirc;&nbsp; boolean flags indicating their state as "potential". This greatly
	  &Acirc;&nbsp; simplifies some tests and makes the code more readable. * When
	  I am adding a chunk based on a single point to an existing stem, &Acirc;&nbsp;
	  I always mark the second point as "potential". Later this state can
	  &Acirc;&nbsp; be changed if check based on the second point produces the
	  same chunk, &Acirc;&nbsp; or at least doesn't produce another (conflicting)
	  stem. Again, this &Acirc;&nbsp; simplifies some tests which accompany adding
	  new chunks and makes the &Acirc;&nbsp; result of the stem detection less
	  dependent from the order in which &Acirc;&nbsp; the points are processed.
	  * I allow assigning a point to a stem even when its distance from the
	  &Acirc;&nbsp; stem edge is larger than standard dist_error_hv or dist_error_diag,
	  &Acirc;&nbsp; if only the difference between maximum possible deviations
	  to the &Acirc;&nbsp; both sides of the edge doesn't exceed the double
	  dist_error_* value. &Acirc;&nbsp; This prevents us from adding several
	  almost-coincident hints, actually &Acirc;&nbsp; controlling the same stem.
	  * I have added a function which performs some stem normalization, &Acirc;&nbsp;
	  sorting chunks by point coordinates. For HV stems it also can &Acirc;&nbsp;
	  slightly modify the positioning of the stem edges preferring the &Acirc;&nbsp;
	  coordinate which is closer to most points assigned to each edge. * There
	  is now a special function used to compare conflicting stems &Acirc;&nbsp;
	  and decide if one of these two should be preferred, or they both are
	  &Acirc;&nbsp; worth to be output. * The detection of serifs and similar elements,
	  which, not being &Acirc;&nbsp; exactly horizontal/vertical, still have to
	  be marked with a HV &Acirc;&nbsp; stem, has been improved (two points, forming
	  a serif termination, &Acirc;&nbsp; now should not necessarily follow each
	  other).

	  Drat. If we had libjpeg and not libpng we'd get a complaint about an undefined
	  symbol.
	<LI>
	  Add "Mismatch Unicode &amp; Name" to the Find Problems dlg.
	<LI>
	  There are ttf files in existance where glyph names do not match unicode code
	  points. Tons of fonts use ".notdef" for glyphs other than "GID=0". Other
	  fonts use ASCII glyph names (space, exclam, numbersign,...) for glyphs in
	  other scripts (Kedage-n.ttf does this).
	<LI>
	  In the past, ff has felt that the presence of a zero-width ".null" and
	  "nonmarkingreturn" glyph meant that a font was not mono-space. In the future
	  ignore these glyphs when determining whether a font has fixed width.
	<LI>
	  in some rare cases we got an uninitialized value in spline-&gt;line display
	  conversion.

	  The routine to create an apple state machine from a set of OpenType
	  ('init','medi','fina','isol') forms would often crash.
	<LI>
	  When scaling BlueValues, or other arrays, a trailing space after the last
	  number and before the ']' was considered an error. If found then ff would
	  not scale that entry.
