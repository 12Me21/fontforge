<UL>
  <LI>
    22-Aug-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Fix simplify again
      <LI>
	Patch from Andrey V. Panov to improve bluevalues
      <LI>
	KDE refused to make the find problems explanation window visible, so now
	I shan't make it invisible in the first place.
      <LI>
	Generate mac family crashed instead (introduced 2-July)
    </UL>
  <LI>
    20-Aug-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Support for <A HREF="http://potrace.sf.net/">potrace</A>
      <LI>
	Fix some bugs with simplify more
      <LI>
	Mac build was badly configured and linked with a shared library it should
	not have.
      <LI>
	When compiled with -O2 pfaedit had rounding errors which resulted in a bad
	bezier order3=&gt;order2 conversion (PS-&gt;TTF)
      <LI>
	SetPanose sometimes didn't
      <LI>
	Patch from KANOU to set ulUnicodeRange for version 4
    </UL>
  <LI>
    18-Aug-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	<FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><BIG>PfaEdit did not interpret SVG relative paths
	properly, and did not generate correct SVG output because of
	this</BIG></STRONG></FONT>. PfaEdit was mistakenly assuming things should
	be interpreted as in the Type1 rrcurveto operator (where each point is relative
	to the previous point in the operator) rather than the rcurveto operator
	(where each point is relative to the initial point).
      <LI>
	If PfaEdit opened a Bold font stored in OTF CFF format, then when it closed
	that font it would either crash, or screw up memory so that a crash would
	happen later.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    17-Aug-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Support for contextual, chaining contextual and reverse chaining contextual
	sub-tables of GPOS/GSUB.
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    Will generate an Apple contextual glyph substitution table if:
	    <OL>
	      <LI>
		There is an apple feature which matches the otf tag
	      <LI>
		The sub-table is in coverage format
	      <LI>
		The sub-table contains either exactly one nested single glyph replacement
		substitution, or<BR>
		it contains exactly two single glyph replacements and one of them refers
		to the last glyph matched (and the other does not)
	    </OL>
	</UL>
      <LI>
	KANOU points out that on screens with high dpi PfaEdit would sometimes draw
	splines 2 pixels wide and sometimes 1 pixel wide (122dpi had this effect)
      <LI>
	KANOU provided another patch for reading bitmaps one part covered a memory
	leak the other fixed a bug reading ttc files.
      <LI>
	Added a LoadEncodingFile scripting command
      <LI>
	New french ui.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit was using the wrong definition of ascent &amp; descent to set those
	fields in the 'hhea' table. This confused some mac programs (perhaps others).
      <LI>
	Added a "BBox" item to CharInfo scripting.
      <LI>
	Added a FontsInFile scripting command to return an array containing the fontnames
	of all fonts in a file. If an error occurs, a zero length array is returned.
      <LI>
	Change so that when opening a file containing multiple fonts the font's filename
	contains the fontname (so it is possible to open other fonts from the same
	file).
      <LI>
	Kanou provides a patch for compressing bitmaps with more than 8 bits of white
	space to their left.
      <LI>
	Markus Schwarzenberg provides a patch to make pfaedit recognize $cidfamilyname
	as it should have done.
      <LI>
	Add the ability to generate fonts which contain both OpenType and Apple Advanced
	Typography tables (ie. a font that should work everywhere).
      <LI>
	Added Utf8(int), Chr(int), Ord(int) to interconvert between strings and their
	encodings.
      <LI>
	Add two problems to Find problems
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    Search for substitutions, contexts, kerning classes, etc. which refer to
	    a name which does not match any glyph in the font
	  <LI>
	    Search for contexts, chains, etc. which refer to a nested lookup which does
	    not exist
	</UL>
      <LI>
	Add a new command line argument "-last" which will load the last sfd file
	closed. 
	  <HR>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit would crash when importing bitmap fonts
      <LI>
	PfaEdit would crash when trying to do an Element-&gt;Default ATT-&gt;Suffix
	to Tag command
    </UL>
  <LI>

	      <LI>
		<FONT COLOR="Red"><B>Type argument to SelectByATT has changed</B></FONT>!!!
	    </UL>
	</UL>
      <LI>
	Add support for other Pairwise positioning features.
      <LI>
	Add a $panose command to return an array of panose values (scripting)
      <LI>
	Add a SetPanose command allowing scripts to change panose values
      <LI>
	PfaEdit was not rotating .vert glyphs properly
    </UL>
  <LI>
    31-Jul-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Installed KANOU's fix for a buffer overrun
      <LI>
	Installed KANOU's fix for compacted cid-keyed fonts
      <LI>
	Fixed another bug with compacted cid-keyed fonts
      <LI>
	Mathias Wollin points out that my pfm files don't have the correct kerning
	table format
      <LI>
	Handles the case where a font has both a 'glyf' and a 'CFF ' table by asking
	user which to use
      <LI>
	Various improvements to the goto dialog from James Crippen.
      <LI>
	If the ttf "Apple" box got checked then it remained checked in subsequent
	Generate Fonts even though the [Options] dialog did not show it checked.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit would crash if given an Anchor class with no marks.
      <LI>
	Hmm... I notice that volt only uses format 2 coverage tables. I wonder if
	windows fails to handle format 1 tables...
    </UL>
  <LI>
    30-Jul-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Add support for <A HREF="http://www.w3c.org/TR/SVG11/fonts.html">svg fonts</A>
	(and add dependency on libxml2 for reading them in)
      <LI>
	Add support for importing/exporting svg files (again libxml2 needed for import)
      <LI>
	Add support for required features.
      <LI>
	In quadratic fonts the ellipse tool did not draw ellipses
      <LI>
	Add support for rectangles/ellipses drawn center out rather than just within
	the bounding box
      <LI>
	Preserve the rect/ellipse tool settings across invocations
      <LI>
	Put a license entry into the help menu
    </UL>
  <LI>
    20-Jul-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	made the default linux browser be mozilla rather than netscape.
      <LI>
	If the metrics view were displaying an anchored pair (mark-base), and a character
	were typed into the text field at top before the anchored pair, then the
	display got very strange.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit got confused when merging a font which contained multiple encodings
	for the same glyph
      <LI>
	PfaEdit got confused if there were an lparen in a directory name (thought
	this meant a font collection).
    </UL>
  <LI>
    15-Jul-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	We weren't parsing any type3 fonts properly any more
      <LI>
	Extend our ps interpreter to understand some of METAPOST's idioms better.
      <LI>
	I used to call all characters which weren't in the encoding ".notdef" this
	could cause problems if a user forgot to name them. I now give them unique
	names starting with "NameMe". I still leave characters &lt;256 called ".notdef"
	if the encoding calls for it, this may be a mistake...
      <LI>
	Fix on 14-July to simplify was incomplete.
      <LI>
	More fiddling with autohint
      <LI>
	Added support for the new X11 opentype bitmap format.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    14-Jul-2003 (Bastille Day!)
    <UL>
      <LI>
	There are still cases where I'm getting the truetype point count wrong. If
	a truetype file had a control point that lay under an end point, then I would
	treat that as a "no control point" mark, and ignore the cp. But if I do that
	blindly I mess up the point count, so during font generation I must be prepared
	to put the cp back.
      <LI>
	Kanou provided a patch to fix a bug in the underlying graphics library.
      <LI>
	Add a popup menu to Show Att to allow those data to be saved (as utf8 text)
      <LI>
	Fixed (I hope) right to left kerning
      <LI>
	Added 'ccmp' entries by default for Hebrew
      <LI>
	Fixed a couple of bugs with the new simplify more options
      <LI>
	pfaedit didn't compile on solaris. It now does.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    12-Jul-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Remove weirdness in scripting interface to TeX font parameters
      <LI>
	Kanou points out that the code for reading format 4 embedded (ttf) bitmaps
	was ambiguous and would behave incorrectly sometimes. He provided a patch.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit used not to create ghost hints for curved splines. It does now.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit did not find some of the hints needed for n021004l.pfb
      <LI>
	New French UI
      <LI>
	PfaEdit would sometimes crash when autotracing characters
      <LI>
	Don't snap to points when moving control points
      <LI>
	Directory browsing didn't work if the local encoding wasn't latin1 and the
	directory name contain non-ascii characters.
      <LI>
	Add an entry to find problems to look for 'GSUB' entries to non-existant
	characters.
      <LI>
	Expanded the simplify more command
      <LI>
	The GPOS output routines got very unhappy if a duplicate glyph happened to
	have GPOS data. Fixed on both ends I hope.
      <LI>
	The pcf reader was unhappy if
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    the glyph bb width was a multiple of 8 (we read an extra byte per line which
	    made the result appear as garbage)
	  <LI>
	    several glyphs had the same name.
	</UL>
      <LI>
	the FontInfo dlg failed to parse the merge_with field of Anchor Classes properly,
	meaning that each time [OK] was pressed in fontinfo each anchor class name
	got a number prepended to it.
      <LI>
	Change the way the merge_with field of anchor classes is handled by the UI
	so that it makes more sense. We used to display a number, now display the
	name of another anchor class with which it can be merged.
      <LI>
	Added an arabic text sample, courtesy of Thomas Milo.
      <LI>
	Upgraded to Unicode 4.0 (<FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Note:
	<A HREF="http://libuninameslist.sf.net/">libuninameslist</A> has also been
	upgraded</STRONG></FONT>)
      <LI>
	Added a new preference item CharCenterHighest to assist in accent placement.
	  <HR>
      <LI>
	Oh. This isn't documented, but each langsys table can only point to one (1)
	feature with a given tag. So if I have multiple 'mark' lookups, I can't have
	multiple 'mark' features, I must have one 'mark' feature with pointers to
	many lookups.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit could crash when generating a tfm file from a CID keyed font
      <LI>
	Change GDEF output so that the class def table isn't generated when it isn't
	needed (we used to generate a 0 length one, which would confuse the freetype-1
	opentype code, and perhaps others).
      <LI>
	Fixed a bug in autohint caused by negative stem widths.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    4-July-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Added a page to the font info dlg which allows users to set TeX font parameters
      <LI>
	Added a mechanism for specifying TeX charlists and extension characters
      <LI>
	Added a mechanism for specifying TeX Italic Correction
      <LI>
	Revamped support for reading tfm files so that it sets all these new things
	correctly.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    2-July-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Add an Options dialog to the Generate Font window, and remove the check boxes
	from it.
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    Add a UI for the 'PfEd' table
	  <LI>
	    Add a UI to turn off PostScript hinting
	</UL>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit can now generate a tfm and enc file (for TeX)
    </UL>
