	  <B><BIG>Layers</BIG></B>
	  <P>
	  The big change in this release is that every font database can now contain
	  multiple layers. Before this all layers in a font used the same type of splines
	  and there were only 2 or 3 of them.
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      Guideline semi-layer -- where all the glyphs of the font shared the same
	      set of outlines, to which points would snap if desired.
	    <LI>
	      A background layer -- which could contain outlines and also images which
	      could be autotraced into the foreground layer.
	    <LI>
	      A foreground layer -- which was what the font really looked like, and what
	      went into generated fonts
	  </UL>
	  <P>
	  Now there may be any number of layers, and each layer can contain different
	  types of splines -- so one database can contain both quadratic and cubic
	  data and can be store data for both PostScript and TrueType fonts.
	  <P>
	  In a normal font all glyphs have the same number of layers (this is not true
	  in a type3 font, which each glyph may have it's own set of layers). You may
	  set the number, names and types of layers width the <CODE>Element-&gt;Font
	  Info-&gt;Layers</CODE> pane.
	  <P>
	  In the font view you can select which layer is active (and displayed) with
	  the <CODE>View-&gt;Layers</CODE> menu item. You can copy selected glyphs
	  of one layer to another (automagically adjusting the spline type if needed)
	  with <CODE>Edit-&gt;Copy Layer To Layer</CODE>. You can compare to layers
	  for differences with <CODE>Element-&gt;Compare Layers...</CODE>.
	  <P>
	  In the character view the Layers palette has changed. The things which controlled
	  the visibility of hints have moved to the <CODE>View-&gt;Show</CODE> menu
	  (as have some other entries that used to be in the top level
	  <CODE>View</CODE> menu). The layers palette solely displays the glyph's layers
	  and controls which layer is active.
	  <P>
	  The <CODE>File-&gt;Generate Fonts...</CODE> dialog allows you to specify
	  which layer is to go into the font. Note that many things remain common:
	  the hints and truetype instructions apply to all layers. GPOS, GSUB, kern,
	  and morx information is common all layers. The outlines may differ in detail,
	  but outlines from which a font will be generated should have the same shape.
	  <P>
	  Add new python stuff to handle layers:
	  <DL>
	    <DT>
	      fontforge.activeLayer()
	    <DD>
	      Returns the currently active layer
	    <DT>
	      font.layer_cnt
	    <DD>
	      Returns the number of layers in the font
	    <DT>
	      font.layers
	    <DD>
	      A dictionary like object which can be indexed either by an integer between
	      0 (inclusive) and layer_cnt (exclusive) or by the name of a layer. After
	      indexing it returns a LayerInfo object. LayerInfo objects have no independant
	      existance, and contain a layer's name and a boolean indicating whether the
	      layer is_quadratic.
	      <BLOCKQUOTE>
		<PRE>font.layers[1].name = "Foreground"
font.layers[0].is_quadratic = TRUE
</PRE>
	      </BLOCKQUOTE>
	      <DL>
		<DT>
		  You may delete a layer
		<DD>
		  <CODE>del font.layers["Extra layer"]</CODE>
		<DT>
		  You may add a new layer
		<DD>
		  <CODE>font.layers.add("name",is_quadratic)</CODE>
	      </DL>
	      <P>
	      (this object has an iterator which returns the names of all layers)
	    <DT>
	      glyph.layer_cnt
	    <DD>
	      Returns the number of layers in the glyph (this is the same as the number
	      in the font, except for type3 fonts).
	    <DT>
	      glyph.layers
	    <DD>
	      Returns a dictionary like object which may be indexed by layer name or an
	      integer [0,layer_cnt) as above. The result is a standard layer object. (this
	      object has an iterator which returns the names of all layers)
	    <DT>
	      glyph.reflayers
	    <DD>
	      Returns a dictionary like object which may be indexed by layer name or an
	      integer [0,layer_cnt) as above. The result is a standard list of references.
	      (this object has an iterator which returns the names of all layers)
	    <DT>
	      layer.export
	    <DD>
	      It is now possible to export the contours of a layer (before only glyphs
	      could be exported)
	    <DT>
	      glyph.export
	    <DD>
	      Slight change to the semantics. When outputting an outline file, there is
	      now an optional second argument which specifies the layer to output. (again
	      integer or layer name).
	    <DT>
	      font.generate
	    <DD>
	      Has a new keyword argument "layer" to specify which layer should be output.
	  </DL>
	<LI>
	  M.P. Suzuki requests a way to load the entire 'glyf' table of a ttc. Actually
	  he would like to load all 'glyf' tables of a ttc, but that would cause all
	  kinds of problems (multiple fpgm, prep, maxp, cvt tables, trying to fix up
	  GIDs in GPOS/GSUB/kern/* tables, dealing with fonts with so many glyphs they
	  could not be generated, ...)
	  <P>
	  So the command line now takes an --allglyphs argument, and the scripting
	  open commands now take a value of 4 for the openflags argument to mean this.
	<LI>
	  Add a command Points-&gt;Make Arc, which is similar to Points-&gt;Make Line
	  except that it connects the two points with an elliptical arc rather than
	  a straight line. The ellipse is choosen to run through the two points (obviously)
	  and to be tangent to the slope of those points. This isn't enough information
	  to determine an ellipse uniquely (three points and two tangents being required)
	  so in general there will be an infinite number of solutions (and it is possible
	  to provide contradictory input so that no ellipse can be found). FontForge
	  may not choose the ellipse you had your heart set on. FF will first attempt
	  to find an ellipse so that one of the points lies on an axis of the ellipse
	  (this will find a circle if there is a circle which satisfies the constraints
	  above). If that fails it will look more generally for ellipses.
	  <P>
	  (If you hold down the <Alt> key when you select the menu item, FF will leave
	  the ellipse it calculated in the background layer. That was a debugging technique
	  but I thought it was kind of interesting and left it in.)
	<LI>
	  Further improvements in calculating active zones for curved segments for
	  autohinging: if the spline is closer to the opposed stem edge at the given
	  point, don't extend the active zone any longer.
	  <P>
	  If a line's unit vector is close enough to the font's italic slant, then
	  prefer the unit vector based on the italic slant instead.
	  <P>
	  Added an experimental mode which allows to build glyph data based on a
	  preexisting hint layout and extend it with additional stems.
	<LI>
	  The rotate tool in char view didn't show the angle of rotation.
	<LI>
	  Fixed various uninitialized values
	<LI>
	  Make sure the first character in marlett is 0xf020.
	<LI>
	  Reinstate the behavior of the symbol encoding that the wine developers depend
	  on.
	<LI>
	  Add a scripting flag so that script writers can control whether a font has
	  a symbol encoding without having to use a funky extension. (Wine people don't
	  like having to say ".sym.ttf").
	<LI>
	  When building a ligature, ff would mark the first letter with use_my_metrics.
	  That should only happen when building accented glyphs.
	<LI>
	  Put in a way for the user to leap easily from Font Info-&gt;Unicode Ranges
	  to Font Info-&gt;OS/2-&gt;Charsets-&gt;Unicode Ranges.
	<LI>
	  python scripting font.sfnt_names would sometimes crash.
	<LI>
	  When a matrixedit is initialized its last visible column (especially if followed
	  by hidden columns) may not be at the edge of the matrixedit. This lead to
	  drawing spurious lines which annoyed Alexej.
	<LI>
	  When running simplify on a quadratic contour and the contour doubles back
	  on itself, FF would do an optimization which only worked for cubics.
	<LI>
	  Werner tells me that if bit 1 of the 'head'.flags field is clear then I should
	  adjust so that the left side bearing is what is specified in the 'hmtx' table.
	<LI>
	  Pdf filter decode didn't work if given an array of filters (not even in the
	  array contain only a single filter).
	<LI>
	  FontForge doesn't support pdf encryption which seems to require a license
	  from RSA. Before we'd just announce failure for no reason, now announce that
	  the file is encrypted and we can't read it.
	<LI>
	  Improper test for point matching in references (in tt).
	<LI>
	  In an un instructed font, the [Default] button in FontInfo-&gt;Grid Fitting
	  produces the wrong result (and has since I added support for the new gasp
	  features of ClearType.
	<LI>
	  Doing hint modifications caused errant pointers to be used. Often crashing.
	<LI>
	  Math strings weren't getting initialized in math kern.
	<LI>
	  One of the math constants had the wrong friendly name.
	<LI>
	  Michal points out that tooltips in the math window don't get translated.
	<LI>
	  TopLeft/TopRight etc. in math kerning weren't translated.
	<LI>
	  The transform menu item seems to have lost its shortcut. Put it back.
	<LI>
	  When selecting a control point in the outline view, we would always select
	  the next point if both next and prev were in the same place (ie, on the base
	  point itself). But when the point is at the end of an open contour, the one
	  which should be selected is the one which controls a spline (which need not
	  be the next one).
	<LI>
	  Oh dear. My original method for storing background layers didn't allow for
	  references (because I didn't put them in the background). But I need them
	  now.
	<LI>
	  Label some of the horizontal metrics lines
	<LI>
	  Trying to move the top accent line resulted in a crash.
	<LI>
	  Drat. FF really wants to set the latin1 codepage bit, even if the user explicitly
	  provides the codepage settings. The wine people don't like that.
	<LI>
	  If we have two fonts open, a type3 (multilayered) one and a normal outline,
	  and we have outline glyph windows open from each font, and we move the focus
	  between the glyph windows, then the layers palette will get left behind when
	  focus moves to the other font. (and other more complex senarios when switching
	  between multilayered and outline).
	<LI>
	  When loading a feature file, ff would complain if a mark appeared in two
	  anchor classes -- even if those classes were in separate lookups. This meant
	  it got unhappy about a mark which was in both a mark 2 mark lookup and in
	  a mark to base lookup.
	<LI>
	  I had intended not to give warning messages about names like "nine.oldstyle"
	  (defined in Adobe's obsolete PUA mapping) when loading a tt font, if such
	  a glyph had a different unicode mapping (or none) than the one Adobe used
	  ages ago. But I screwed up and was generating messages anyway.
	<LI>
	  When converting cubics to quadratics, if we had a curved spline where one
	  of the endpoints of the spline had no control point, then we'd get a slope
	  at that point of 0/0. This meant that we tried to put a quadratic control
	  point on top of that endpoint which looked confusing and seemed unnecessary.
	<LI>
	  Typo in glyph compare. Caused another crash when comparing lookups.
	<LI>
	  Didn't handle NULL tokens properly when reading in a feature file.
	<LI>
	  Make it easier to select control points when the alt key is down.
	<LI>
	  Add a mechanism for getting default values for private dict entries in python
	  scripts.
	  <P>
	  (Also provide default values now when [Add]ing private entries in Font Info.
	<LI>
	  Making class0 editable broke the ability to create a context chaining class
	  lookup.
	<LI>
	  The encapsulation for creating libfontforge broke importing a lookup from
	  one font to another.
	<LI>
	  Feature file generation omitted a semicolon after (some) contextual lookup
	  rules.
	<LI>
	  Nasty bug with references in ApplySubstitutions scripting command.
	<LI>
	  Mark classes didn't work.
	<LI>
	  Michal N. points out that "Really Use Typo Metrics" should be moved above
	  the typo metrics (or below) but should not be in the middle of them.
	  <P>
	  He also tells me that the internationalized weight classes don't get parsed
	  properly.
	<LI>
	  Someone handed me a font with a SJIS encoding cmap. The cmap mapped a glyph
	  to SJIS 128, which isn't a valid SJIS code point. FF got an insane result
	  when trying to convert to unicode and crashed. Add a check against bad code
	  points.
	<LI>
	  Add two proposed features from the pre-draft of OT 1.6
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      Drop Caps
	    <LI>
	      Character Variants 00-99

	<LI>
	  Werner wants to be able to select text in the warnings window to paste elsewhere.
	  And he points out some scrolling flaws as well.
	<LI>
	  Could not attach lookups to mac feature settings.
	<LI>
	  Clean up some display problems in the type3 layers palette and layer info
	  dlg.
      </UL>
    <LI>

	  New Vietnamese translation from Clytie
	<LI>
	  New Russian translation from Alexandre Prokoudne.
	<LI>
	  New Polish translation from Michal N. .
	<LI>
	  FF could crash if a cmap subtable contained invalid encoding points.
	<LI>
	  Add various new features/scripts/language tags from OpenType draft 1.5.
	<LI>
	  Add two proposed features from the pre-draft of OT 1.6

	  The warnings window didn't resize properly. It didn't let you copy text (ie.
	  a warning) It didn't enough. It should have scrolled with keypad keys (arrows,
	  page up/down, etc). There should be a way to clear the windows so you know
	  that all the warnings are from a given operation. Added a popup menu.
	<LI>
	  Fixed a problem in the auto hinter.
	<LI>
	  Could not attach lookups to mac feature settings.
	<LI>
	  Clean up some display problems in the type3 layers palette and layer info
	  dlg.
	<LI>
	  Autoinstructor: turned on strong point interpolation:
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      Various important outline points are correctly placed between hints' edges.
	    <LI>
	      Potential benefits for DStem positioning.
	    <LI>
	      Drawbacks: 2x slower, code generated is now much bigger.
	  </UL>
	<LI>
	  The merge (and simplify) command could produce odd results if the points
	  surrounding the merge had no control points.
	<LI>
	  Extend find/replace to handle changing angles.
	<LI>
	  The Display/Print dlg would crash when the user pressed the reset button
	  if there were at least two pointsizes of the font on display. Perhaps in
	  other cases too.
	<LI>
	  Make shift click in the lookup dialog (but not the subtable part) select
	  all lookups between current click and a previously selected point.
	<LI>
	  glyph.addPosSub doesn't work for ligatures or multiple substitutions. It
	  treats both as alternate substitutions.
	<LI>
	  Michal Now. points out that there are some strings not marked for translation
	  in cvruler.c.
	<LI>
	  FontForge never checked that fonts had fewer than 65536 glyphs. I just blythely
	  assumed I wouldn't have to worry. Well someone handed me a font with 65731
	  glyphs, and FF treated it as having 195 glyphs. Things got nasty after the
	  196th.
	<LI>
	  Fix a crash in autohint.c and an infinite loop in stemdb.c.
	<LI>
	  Font Compare would crash if one font had a lookup subtable which was not
	  in the other.
	<LI>
	  Improve the algorithm used to detect reference points for stem edges. Enable
	  snapping "corner extrema" to predefined hints.
	<LI>
	  Remove the obsolete Private Dict to CVT table command.
	<LI>
	  Michal Now. wants short cuts to change grid fit attributes, so a new sub
	  menu with things like increase point size, change AA, etc. (with shortcuts,
	  of course).
	<LI>
	  Patch by Michal Nowakowski. In Show Grid fit not setting the mono bit correctly
	  in freetype.
	<LI>
	  Bug in pfm file output.
	<LI>
	  If we failed to open a plugin library during init, it would call LogError
	  before the display was initialized, leading to a crash.
	<LI>
	  Autoinstructor: If a horizontal stem interpolated between blue zones was
	  very close to one of them, it often jumped beyond that zone in small ppems.
	  This was especcially annoying for serif fonts.
	<LI>
	  Improvements (I hope) to the ruler tool
	  <OL>
	    <LI>
	      Make it snap to splines (in addition to points)
	    <LI>
	      Have it draw a line from the start point to the mouse
	    <LI>
	      If they start on a spline, then include info on the offset in coordinates
	      parallel to the spline and normal to it.
	    <LI>
	      Provide a "spline length" if the start and end points are on the same spline
	      (instead of just if they were the end-points of the spline).
	  </OL>
	<LI>
	  In python scripting contour.reverseDirection only worked on closed contours.
	<LI>
	  If you click wildly in the cvt editor it would eventually go into infinite
	  recursion.
	<LI>
	  If there were no free anchor class then attempting to add an anchor point
	  would pop up the Mark Classes pane of Font Info (rather than Lookups). This
	  is sufficiently close to Anchor Class as to be very confusing.
	<LI>
	  Make label gadgets (and buttons which are also labels) handle multiline text.
	<LI>
	  If the user closes the font info dlg when there are mark class dialogs floating
	  around then close them too (there was code which was supposed to do this,
	  but it didn't work).
	<LI>
	  Try to make it clear in the Mark Classes pane of the Font Info that mark
	  classes are not anchor classes. Someone got confused...
	<LI>
	  Fix some bugs in parsing mark anchors in feature files.
	<LI>
	  When adding an hvcurve point into an existing spline it behaved like a curved
	  point and laid parallel to the spline rather than being either horiz or vert.
	<LI>
	  FontForge uses floats (which have ~24 bits of precision internally) to represent
	  coordinates. Type2 fonts use a 16.16 fixed notation, which means that we
	  only represent coordinates
	  <256 accurately. This will cause slight errors during output and input of
	  a font. Unfortunately, due to the rel-rel nature of postscript these slight
	  errors accumulate. <p> So instead, when loading and saving a Type2 font use
	  double precision temporaries. This should mean there will be no errors to
	  accumulate. There will be slight errors when converted to SplinePoints, but
	  these errors will not accumulate.
	<LI>
	  Check several adjacent splines when detecting active zones for curved segments
	  and thus make the algorithm less dependent from the number of additional
	  points on a contour and their exact positions.
	<LI>
	  Fix a number of problems that -pedantic complains about.
	<LI>
	  Some mnemonics in the Element menu are used for two items. Clean it up a
	  bit.
	<LI>
	  Add a "Find Problems" for non integral coordinates.
	  <P>
	  Change the "Ref with bad ttf transformation" so that it checks for integral
	  coordinates too.
	<LI>
	  the glyph.validate function in python was marked as taking NOARGS in the
	  method table, but, in fact, does take arguments.
	<LI>
	  Oops. Validate used to complain if the StemSnap[HV] array were missing. But
	  that's perfectly ok.
	<LI>
	  Be more lenient when closing a path (when reading in a type1/2 font)... we
	  can get rounding errors.
	<LI>
	  Add a little LogError to let the user know if there are sfnt tables we ignore.
	<LI>
	  Deep in the heart of Find Problems check for bad contour direction, was a
	  bug where it looked at the wrong spline.
	<LI>
	  Just as it is possible to have things in 'morx' that are not in 'GSUB', it
	  is possible that a 'GPOS' table contains no kerning information but a 'kern'
	  table does. We used not to read 'kern' if we had 'GPOS', be a little subtler
	  and check for the presence of a 'kern' feature inside 'GPOS' before deciding
	  whether to read the 'kern' table.
	<LI>
	  The anchor control dialog didn't work for mark to mark anchors when looking
	  at a base mark.
	<LI>
	  When a font contained glyphs with multiple encodings, then ff would produce
	  bdf files with a char count which matched the # glyphs, not the number of
	  encoding slots used.
	<LI>
	  In a compacted cid font, the status line (containing unicode, unicode block/name,
	  etc) was junk.
	<LI>
	  Barry wants to be able to mark that it's ok for a spline to have intermediate
	  extrema.
	<LI>
	  The []TeX Table checkbox was always disabled in the save font dlg.
	<LI>
	  The DejaVu people want to be able to associate a comment with a cvt entry.
	<LI>
	  Find Problems-&gt;ATT-&gt;Missing glyph name complains about the special
	  string <Delete> which I used in Apple lookups to represent the "Delete Glyph"
	  action that apple supports and OT does not. Don't complain about this any
	  more.
	  <P>
	  Add a problem which will look at the glyphs a lookup is active for, and then
	  checks the script of each glyph against the scripts attached to the features
	  which invoke this lookup. If the script doesn't match anything, then complain.
	<LI>
	  If a font contained an empty anchor class (having either no base glyphs or
	  no mark glyphs) then when dumping out the font subsequent anchor classes
	  got the wrong data associated with them.
	<LI>
	  Barry wants non-integral hints.
	<LI>
	  Barry points out that Scale To Em doesn't scale the guidelines.
	  <P>
	  Barry also complains that spiro points are rounded. This is more debatable.

	  It used to be that when a font had both 'mor[tx]' and 'GSUB' we would only
	  read 'GSUB'. But Michel Boyer wanted to read both. So... read 'morx' after
	  'GSUB' and if we find a feature/setting that looks as though it corresponds
	  to an existing OpenType lookup (which we can convert to a Mac format) then
	  skip that feature/setting, presuming it to contain redundant data.
	  <P>
	  This is a finer grain approach, but similar to, the previous one. There we
	  skipped the whole table, presuming it redundant. But in CharisSIL the morx
	  table has a lot of functionality orthogonal to GSUB. So we must parse both.

	  of point data objects. Instead I use just 'l' and 'r' accompanied by
	  &Acirc;&nbsp; boolean flags indicating their state as "potential". This greatly
	  &Acirc;&nbsp; simplifies some tests and makes the code more readable. * When
	  I am adding a chunk based on a single point to an existing stem, &Acirc;&nbsp;
	  I always mark the second point as "potential". Later this state can
	  &Acirc;&nbsp; be changed if check based on the second point produces the
	  same chunk, &Acirc;&nbsp; or at least doesn't produce another (conflicting)
	  stem. Again, this &Acirc;&nbsp; simplifies some tests which accompany adding
	  new chunks and makes the &Acirc;&nbsp; result of the stem detection less
	  dependent from the order in which &Acirc;&nbsp; the points are processed.
	  * I allow assigning a point to a stem even when its distance from the
	  &Acirc;&nbsp; stem edge is larger than standard dist_error_hv or dist_error_diag,
	  &Acirc;&nbsp; if only the difference between maximum possible deviations
	  to the &Acirc;&nbsp; both sides of the edge doesn't exceed the double
	  dist_error_* value. &Acirc;&nbsp; This prevents us from adding several
	  almost-coincident hints, actually &Acirc;&nbsp; controlling the same stem.
	  * I have added a function which performs some stem normalization, &Acirc;&nbsp;
	  sorting chunks by point coordinates. For HV stems it also can &Acirc;&nbsp;
	  slightly modify the positioning of the stem edges preferring the &Acirc;&nbsp;
	  coordinate which is closer to most points assigned to each edge. * There
	  is now a special function used to compare conflicting stems &Acirc;&nbsp;
	  and decide if one of these two should be preferred, or they both are
	  &Acirc;&nbsp; worth to be output. * The detection of serifs and similar elements,
	  which, not being &Acirc;&nbsp; exactly horizontal/vertical, still have to
	  be marked with a HV &Acirc;&nbsp; stem, has been improved (two points, forming
	  a serif termination, &Acirc;&nbsp; now should not necessarily follow each
	  other).

	  In the past, ff has felt that the presence of a zero-width ".null" and

	      glyphs(type) returns an iterator over all glyphs in the font. If present

	  Python 2.5 initializes itself differently from Python 2.[34]. 2.[34] delay

	  FontForge now stores the "userdata" python members into the sfd file as pickled

	<LI>
	  Add the ability to mark a glyph so that just before being saved its references
	  will be unlinked and we will run remove overlap on it. This means the user

	  I have merged (and substantially rewritten) the Print and Display Dialogs.
	  There is now only one menu item (Print) which (vaguely) the old Display dlg
	  except that it can now be printed. The text area widget now supports OpenType
	  features just as the metrics view does. It also supports ligature carets.
	  <P>
	  The dialog is no longer modal, however it does not get updated with each
	  change to the font (that would make moving a point around in the outline
	  view far too sluggish), instead there is a [Refresh] button the user can
	  press to force an update.
	<LI>
	  It occurred to me that fontforge's current mechanism for setting ligature
	  carets requires that there be a ligature substitution is the exact number
	  of components used to make the glyph. But in indic fonts ligatures are often
	  made up out of other ligatures (I think) which means that there won't be
	  enough caret positions.
	  <P>
	  So I've added a Ligature Caret count to the Element-&gt;Glyph Info dialog
	  to give the user control over it when necessary.
	<LI>
	  Add minimal support for applying apple state machine lookups in metrics view.
	  Support is minimal because:

	    <LI>
	      Apple seems to figure line breaks before doing substitution process but I
	      do it afterward so I don't know where the line breaks are and I can't enter
	      either the line start or line end state.
	    <LI>
	      When I delete a glyph I delete it. Apple inserts a deleted glyph mark and
	      then removes that later. State machines can respond to deleted glyphs, but
	      I can't.

	  Michal Nowakowski has improved the truetype autoinstructor. He warns that

	  with well defined blue zones and stems".
	<LI>
	  If we have a glyph with multiple encodings, and the secondary encodings occur
	  after the primary ones, then the backmap will probably contain a secondary
	  encoding, which means that when we go to load the font in we will probably
	  notice the secondary encoding twice and forget the primary.
	<LI>
	  I used not to distinguish between ligature anchors and normal mark to base
	  anchors. Unfortunately when I moved to lookups (from features) I had to introduce
	  that distinction. But I didn't work through all the implications and have
	  fixed a number of bugs related to that.
	<LI>
	  Barry SCHWARTZ complains that font info says "fontnames must" but that the
	  cited adobe tech note only says "should". So change "must" to "should".
	<LI>
	  When processing class-based contextual lookups fontforge could not handle
	  class 0 (the class containing "all glyphs not in another class") add code
	  to do that.
	<LI>
	  If the user did not select a Gasp Version (note: active selection was needed,
	  just seeing that it was correct and leaving it didn't work) then [OK] would
	  leave the font with an invalid version and on some systems caused a crash.
	<LI>
	  View-&gt;Insert Glyph After didn't work well on a ligature glyph. It would
	  insert the glyph after the first component of the ligature, not after the
	  last -- which would make more sense.
	<LI>
	  Misnamed some private dict entries when loading from otf.
	<LI>
	  Make entry of ghost hints better.
	<LI>
	  Add the ability to determine whether a point is selected or not from python.
	<LI>
	  Add a mechanism so the user can ask fontforge to check for the existance
	  of optional libraries.
	<LI>
	  Add range checks to some library routines which blindly referenced some BMP
	  arrays with codepoints outside bmp. Broken by UCS2-&gt;UCS4 change.
	<LI>
	  Werner wants GotoChar to be able to switch sub-fonts in a cid keyed font.
	  This may introduce bugs...
	<LI>
	  Revert glyph still wasn't working.
	<LI>
	  Someone complained that using a negative stroke took a very long time but
	  produced correct results. Um. Ok. It's easy always to use the absolute value.
	<LI>
	  Oops. The mac uses UCS2 for filenames, so when I moved to UCS4 I should have
	  changed the mac resource file interface.
	<LI>
	  When creating a mac resource file we only set the type/creator fields and
	  failed to initialize the finderFlags.
	<LI>
	  Fixed crash bug in generating a cursive connection anchor sub-table.
	<LI>
	  In TrueType composite glyphs with the USE_MY_METRICS bit set the lock icon
	  wasn't scrolled properly.
	<LI>
	  The change from UCS2 to UCS4 broke text copy/paste.<BR>
	  We failed to add a terminating NUL of the right size in all cases<BR>
	  We continued to use charset=UCS-2 when it should have been UCS-4
	<LI>
	  FF crashed when trying to View-&gt;Show ATT on a font that appears to me
	  to contain an invalid 'kern' sub-table. I have removed the proximate cause
	  of the crash. I have provided a warning that the kern table appears invalid.
	  And I have cleaned up my internals after detecting the bad sub-table (I had
	  a lookup with a feature but no script and this caused problems).
	<LI>
	  Multiple substitutions in the metrics view did not properly update the count
	  of glyphs to be displayed.
	<LI>
	  If nothing changed in the metrics input field and the output contained a
	  ligature (or a mult subs I suspect). FF would complain.
	<LI>
	  in python, font.generate() didn't work. The PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords behaves
	  in a way I did not expect.
	<LI>
	  [Bottom] and [Down] still didn't work for lookup subtables.
	<LI>
	  Try to force the text field in the metricsview to a fixed size. In some fonts
	  it seems to be initialized to a huge value.
	<LI>
	  Add ability to display italic side bearings in the char view.
	<LI>
	  The lines drawn for italic fonts to show the italic origin and width were
	  at slightly the wrong angle (I used a sine when I should have used a tangent).
	<LI>
	  If a font did not have any horizontal metrics then ff would not set the em-size.
	<LI>
	  Show Att trampled on memory when displaying apple contextual substitution
	  state machines.
	<LI>
	  Wasn't parsing apple's 'lcar' table properly.
	<LI>
	  if a font contained a 'post' table but didn't name all names (or something
	  like that), then the attempt to name the glyph based on the encoding was
	  broken after the encoding change.
	<LI>
	  FF did not recognize that a bdf file was greymaped. Broken by the bdf properties
	  work a year ago or so.
	<LI>
	  The import lookups button in fontinfo forgot about the subtables (sort of).
	<LI>
	  The metricsview used the wrong count field to determine whether things changed.
	  It used the glyph count, not the char count (which meant that when we had
	  a ligature and the number of chars was greater than the number of glyphs,
	  things got confused.)
	<LI>
	  In the metrics view, anchored attachments only worked if the base glyph were
	  itself unmoved (that is the mark was placed relative to the unmoved location,
	  not the actual location).
	<LI>
	  The search dialog should provide user with control over the error bound.<BR>
	  The rotate checkbox didn't work if the flip checkbox wasn't checked.
	<LI>
	  If a replace contour added a control point to a point that did not have one
	  (went from a line to a curve) then that control point would get lost.<BR>
	  If a search matched across the start point of a contour then search/replace
	  could go into an infinite loop if the search and replace paths were the same.
	<LI>
	  Find/Replace (replace) didn't work on quadratic splines.
	<LI>
	  Add two python methods:
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      Layer.interpolateNewLayer(other-layer,amount)
	    <LI>
	      Font.createInterpolatedGlyph(glyph1,glyph2,amount)
	  </UL>
	  <P>
	  The first creates a new layer by interpolating between the current layer
	  and the layer in the first argument.<BR>
	  The second creates a new glyph in the font by interpolating between the first
	  two arguments. The glyph's unicodecode point and name will be copied from
	  the first argument (the font must not already contain this glyph).<BR>
	  If amount is 0 the result will look like the first glyph, if 1 then like
	  the second.
	<LI>
	  When recovering from a crash, FF would sometimes complain about a mismatched
	  version number. Don't.
	<LI>
	  Problems parsing 'mort' tables could cause a crash.
	<LI>
	  When building a contextual lookup, don't list that lookup as something that
	  it could invoke (ie. list all lookups in this table (GPOS/GSUB) except for
	  ourselves). Don't want to encourage users to create infinite lookup loops.
	<LI>
	  Point matching didn't work when there were references to references and multiple
	  references within a glyph.
	<LI>
	  FF was having problems with extension lookups with multiple sub tables.
	<LI>
	  We were trying to print a trailing NUL in some strings from the fontview.
	<LI>
	  Kerning by classes got broken in metricsview by the addition of support for
	  device tables.
	<LI>
	  A GPOS contextual lookup only listed GSUB lookups in the lookup/sequence
	  dlg<BR>
	  Pressing [OK] in the lookup/sequence dlg caused a crash if no lookup selected.
	<LI>
	  Openfontdlg was looking at the filter listbutton rather than the rename namelist
	  listbutton.
	<LI>
	  mf2pt1 now uses "glyph_dimensions" rather than "bbox"
	<LI>
	  The metrics view should now handle device tables.
	<LI>
	  Goto could crash when used on small encodings.
	<LI>
	  -lang wasn't permitted before -c.
	<LI>
	  Use numeric text fields for anchor positioning.
	<LI>
	  Graham Asher points out that the meanings of underline position in the 'post'
	  table and the FontInfo dictionary are different. One refers to the top of
	  the underline rectangle and one to the center of it.
	<LI>
	  Align point would crash if the selected point were the end point of a contour
	  (or if the two points around it were in the same place).
	<LI>
	  The baseline was not properly located when displaying it in the fontview.
	<LI>
	  The scripting command BitmapsAvail would generally cause FF to crash if done
	  when there was a UI..
	<LI>
	  We seem to be misimplementing my obsolete (sfd file) convention for having
	  duplicate encodings point to the same glyph. Result was that occasionally
	  a glyph would be removed and a pointer to something it refered to would be
	  put in its place.
	<LI>
	  Change the name of activeFontInUI to activeFont<BR>
	  Add an activeGlyph method.<BR>
	  Add the ability to call a python script from a outline view.
	<LI>
	  Hmmm. If a textfield is shifted right, and then resized so there's now room
	  for all the text, the unshift it.
	<LI>
	  Werner suggests that it would be useful to be able to specify wildcards in
	  the goto dlg.
	<LI>
	  Michael Zedler tells me that glyphs output by mf2pt1 contain a line:
	  <PRE> % MF2PT1: bbox 0 90 834 422
</PRE>
	  <P>
	  where the third (so called) bounding box entry is actually the glyph's advance
	  width. I was reluctant to use this at first, because that clearly isn't something
	  that belongs in a bounding box...
	<LI>
	  Werner tells me that lilypond uses a slightly different syntax for the MF2PT1
	  bbox comment, so make our parsing slightly more generous.
	<LI>
	  When creating a new lookup subtable for an anchored lookup, it did not get
	  marked as having anchor classes and feature file output failed because of
	  that.
	<LI>
	  When outputing single lookups, the feature, script and language tags all
	  had ^A where they should have had the second letter of the tag.
	<LI>
	  Remove the code to produce the old, broken, 'size' feature.
