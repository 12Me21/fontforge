<UL>
  <LI>
    02-Mar-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Changed the Show Instructions command to be an Edit Instructions
      <LI>
	Bug saving 'prep' table
      <LI>
	Bug changing 'cvt ' table
      <LI>
	Added ability to look at gridfit splines in charview.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    28-Feb-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	New dialog in outline view to examine ttf instructions
      <LI>
	If an sfd file was created from a script then when it was next opened from
	the UI it would appear in a tiny window.
      <LI>
	The preference item refering to the []Hint check box in the generate dlg
	has been renamed.
      <LI>
	A checksum-like thing has been added to ui files so that in the future the
	application will refuse to use .ui files which do not match its expectations.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    27-Feb-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Didn't get the SetLBearing change right yesterday.
      <LI>
	Changing to quadratic splines with Font Info could generate an invalid spline.
      <LI>
	We now preserve truetype instructions when reading in a truetype file (the
	fpgm and prep tables, the cvt table and any per character instructions)
      <LI>
	These instructions will be dumped out when generating truetype fonts
      <LI>
	Added a menu command AutoInstr to generate our own (bad) instructions for
	a character.
      <LI>
	Any significant change (ie. anything that reorders the points, or adds or
	removes points) will clear the instructions for that character.
      <LI>
	Changing to cubic splines (fontwide) will clear the instructions (and the
	fpgm and prep tables).
    </UL>
  <LI>
    26-Feb-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	configure scripts got confused in the freetype libraries were findable but
	the include files were not. Changed the scripts so that freetype is marked
	not present if the include files are missing.
      <LI>
	Table ordering was not read in properly from an sfd file
      <LI>
	Typos in SetCharName &amp; SetUnicodeValue prevented second argument from
	working
      <LI>
	Added a second argument to SetLBearing and friends to allow relative bearing
	settings (ie. to increment the bearing by some amount)
    </UL>
  <LI>
    25-Feb-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Bad bug in GSUB generation introduced yesterday
      <LI>
	Font level round 2 int command now rounds hints too.
      <LI>
	Adobe lies when they say that a hint can't stretch from one bluezone to another,
	so be a bit more cautious in removing this case.
      <LI>
	Be a little better about getting the script from the GSUB/GPOS table. 
	  <HR>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit had problems generating mac cursive connection setting.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit had problems defaulting ligatures in cid keyed fonts (even if there
	were no ligature characters to be defaulted, the attempt would fail)
      <LI>
	I introduced memory problems yesterday. Fixed.
      <LI>
	Font level round 2 int will take hints into account when positioning points
	in order to maintain stem widths. 
	  <HR>
      <LI>
	When running a script from the command line PfaEdit failed to initialize
	the adobe standard encoding.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    24-Feb-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Claudio Beccari has provided an Italian UI.
      <LI>
	(added Italian style translations to fontinfo)
      <LI>
	User now has the ability to control the conversion from mac feature/settings
	to otf features.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit now remembers the order features are to be applied in GSUB/GPOS/morx
	tables (and dumps features out in that order when it next saves them).
      <LI>
	PfaEdit allows you to reorder the GSUB/morx tables should you wish to do
	so. I am sufficiently ignorant that I don't believe it is necessary to reorder
	the GPOS table, so there is currently no UI for this. If I am wrong let me
	know and I will add that too.
      <LI>
	The 'kern' table was not being generated when it should have been. This error
	was introduced sometime in the last month due to the AAT changes.
      <LI>
	Scripts generating otf fonts would crash if the font had non-integral coordinates
	because of a bug in my PostNotice routine when running without X.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    18-Feb-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Hmm. It looks as though apple uses the "ascending glyph" flag on the features
	of the 'mort'/'morx' tables to mean left to right text
      <LI>
	Fixed a crash on reading a GSUB table with a glyph out of range.
      <LI>
	Added support for a cursive connection (contextual glyph substitution subtable
	of) morx.
      <LI>
	Added an <A HREF="realindex.html">index</A> to this manual and put a link
	to it in PfaEdit's Help menu. Index is by no means complete yet.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    12-Feb-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>

	of the 'mort' or 'morx' tables.
      <LI>
	Support for writing those features in non-contextual glyph and ligature
	sub-tables of 'morx'.
      <LI>
	added char info to the fontview popup.
      <LI>
	the scripting command Generate (and GenerateFamily) would generate truetype
	.dfont files when asked to generate otf dfont files.
      <LI>
	Add ClearHints scripting command
      <LI>
	Add access to preference items from scripting (via: $&lt;prefname&gt;,
	GetPref("&lt;prefname&gt;"),
	SetPref("&lt;prefname&gt;",&lt;value&gt;)
    </UL>
  <LI>
    01-Feb-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Add some support for Apple Advanced Typograph tables ('prop', 'lcar')
      <LI>
	Popup menus in textfields failed to refresh the text field
      <LI>
	KANOU provides a patch for sfd files with long Alternate Subs
      <LI>
	FontView didn't deselect properly after doing a drag and drop.

	Ligature carets introduced a crash bug.
    </UL>

    30-Jan-2003
    <UL>

    <UL>
      <LI>
	Fix a crash introduced yesterday.
      <LI>

    </UL>
  <LI>
    28-Jan-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	The title of the Anchor Pair dialog was wrong (said Kern Pairs)
      <LI>
	Improved error messages for when a font file did not exist or was unreadable.
      <LI>
	Failed to generate a GSUB table when the ligatures came from a r2l ttf file.
      <LI>
	I was generating incorrect data for r2l GPOS kerning sub-tables.
      <LI>
	Failed to display r2l anchored attachments properly in the metricsview, anchor
	pair dlg, or when printing.
      <LI>
	Typo when loading libuninameslist dynamic library, introduced on the 24th.
      <LI>
	Now we generate a GDEF table too, containing (possibly) a glyph class def
	and (possibly) a ligature caret list
      <LI>
	Added code for editing horizontal ligature caret locations
    </UL>
  <LI>
    25-Jan-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	More cygwin fixes for invoking browsers.
    </UL>
  <LI>

    <UL>
      <LI>
	Put in a number of errors and warnings related to a glyph not having a script.
      <LI>
	Fixed a crash bug when generating a popup for a glyph with no unicode encoding
      <LI>
	Support for scroll wheels.
      <LI>
	I hope I've now fixed the problems related to the GSUB table and ttc files.
	Now does a pass through the GSUB table to see what glyphs can be introduced
	by it when it figures out what glyphs to read from the glyph table (ttc files
	have more than one font sharing the table, don't want to read all glyphs).
      <LI>
	Added support for extension subtables of GPOS/GSUB.
      <LI>
	Making a selection in the textfield of the Display dlg was broken when the
	selection was scrolled.
      <LI>
	Valek wants a Paste Into command.
      <LI>
	Uninitialized variable in GSUB output caused erratic ligature behavior
      <LI>
	I'm told that even though it makes logical sense for hebrew to have a 'fina'
	tag, it is not customary and I have been asked to remove it from Default
	ATT. Which I have done. 
	  <HR>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit now protects itself better against erroneous GSUB/GPOS tables.
      <LI>
	Valek points out there were display problems with the File-&gt;Display (and
	File-&gt;Print) menu options in Russian.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    16-Jan-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Recent char info changes broke copy &amp; paste within text fields of the
	char info dlg.
      <LI>
	Problems reading GSUB table of a ttc files (problems remain, but we should
	no longer crash).
      <LI>
	Reorganized libraries. Now PfaEdit has an additional dependency:<BR>
	<A HREF="http://libuninameslist.sf.net">libuninameslist</A>. Please install
	this.
      <LI>
	With libuninameslist PfaEdit can display the Unicode annotation information.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    14-Jan-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Fixed a couple of bugs loading pcf files with complex encodings
      <LI>
	Bug in pasting metadata when there was no glyph comment.
      <LI>
	Made SetCharColor scripting command set the color on any selected glyphs
      <LI>
	Cleaned up selection behavior in fontview. Drag &amp; drop made it difficult
      <LI>
	Oops. Was scaling round rect radius incorrectly in xfig conversion
      <LI>
	Oh yes, hebrew has final letters too. And greek. Add them in to the default
	for 'fina'.
      <LI>
	Fixed many problems with mac font generation
      <LI>
	Open VMS update from Jauk Jansen
    </UL>
  <LI>

      <LI>
	Saving a compacted font did not preserve the old encoding
      <LI>
	Added a preference item to control Edit-&gt;Join
      <LI>
	made Edit-&gt;Copy From-&gt;Copy Name (now Metadata) be a preference item
	too.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    9-Jan-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Support for round rects in xfig files
      <LI>
	Added the glyph name to the title of the char info dlg
      <LI>

      <LI>
	GPOS/GSUB output now handles case where a feature has several different sets
	of flags.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    8-Jan-2003
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Update copyright notices
      <LI>
	Printing now handles anchored marks. (Display does not, just as display doesn't
	handle kerning-- because X doesn't).
      <LI>
	Support for curvsive positioning.
      <LI>
	I've registered with Adobe, and they have assigned PfaEdit an XUID base number
	of 1021. Now when new users start pfaedit for the first time they will be
	assigned an XUID base sequence of 1021 xxx nnn where xxx and nnn are two
	random numbers generated by pfaedit. New fonts will get a fourth number for
	their full XUID.
      <LI>
	Kanou points out that glyph names should not contain underscores so redo
	the .cidmap files to change to dashes. Also change "japan1_%d" to "cid-%d"
	to make life easier for me.
      <LI>
	KANOU points out there were places where pfaedit did not check
	psunicodenames_cnt. Once outside of BMP this causes a crash.
      <LI>
	New Japanese UI from KANOU.
      <LI>
	Support for many more GPOS/GSUB sub-tables.
      <LI>
	Keep track of the order in which characters are selected in the fontview
	and recreate that order when user asks to create a metricsview based on the
	fontview's selection
      <LI>
	Make it possible to drag&amp;drop characters from fontview into metricsview
	(again keeping track of selection order)
      <LI>
	Make it possible to drag&amp;drop characters from fontview into charview
	to create references
      <LI>
	Make it possible to drag&amp;drop characters from fontview into charinfo
	to create ligatures, etc.
      <LI>
	Command to set the default values for sub GSUB/GPOS features that are easy
	for PfaEdit to figure out.
      <LI>
	Ability to zoom metrics view.
      <LI>
	Metrics view displays anchor points and does the needed work to position
	the characters. It is also possible to move anchor points around in the metrics
	view.
      <LI>
	Metrics view now has a pop-up menu that allows you to see alternate metrics
      <LI>
	Metrics view now has a submenu (off of View) which allows you to change the
	current glyph to one of its alternates.
      <LI>
	Fixed unintitialized variable what would sometimes cause a crash when storing
	bitmaps in a TTF/OTF file.
      <LI>
	Fixed crash bug in 29-Dec when generating a truetype font without a GPOS
	table.
      <LI>
	Many changes to charinfo dlg. Made non-modal. Can Copy/Paste
	Position/Substitution data.
      <LI>
	Do a minimal amount of work toward supporting the alpha channel of a png
	file.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    29-Dec-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit now supports <A HREF="overview.html#Anchors">anchor points</A> for
	mark to base (ligature and mark) positioning.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit was mistakenly treating NumLock on PC keyboards as if it were the
	command key on Mac keyboards.
      <LI>
	The font info dlg now remembers what tab was last pressed.
      <LI>
	The char info dlg has been restructured. It includes a script field, and
	associates a tag with the ligature (if any).
      <LI>
	I have decided to generate a 'GPOS' table rather than a 'kern' table in truetype
	output as well as in opentype output (unless applemode is set).
      <LI>
	I have changed the default names of items in adobe's private use area to
	match their new conventions. ie. names used to look like "Asmall" and now
	look like "a.sc".
      <LI>
	I have rewritten the way <A HREF="gposgsub.html">GPOS and GSUB</A> tables
	are output. I hope this will not have much effect on users, but it does mean
	that a few more sub-tables are now supported.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    23-Dec-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Various improvements to cubic-&gt;quadratic (truetype) conversion.
      <LI>
	When switching from displaying a 12,8,6,4,3,2,1pt bitmap to a 24pt anti-aliased
	version, pfaedit would fail to update the display.
      <LI>
	The bitmap dlg would come up with the labels for X showing when it should
	have shown those for Win/Mac.
      <LI>
	Inspired by KANOU's mentioning the mona font, I've made it possible to generate
	an ms bitmap only ttf font. This is done by creating dummy glyph and loca
	tables (full of space glyphs) and putting a bitmap scaling table which causes
	the most likely pixelsizes to be scaled from the strikes available.
	<P>
	You can generate this with: [No Outline Font] [In TTF]
      <LI>
	Drat. Fix of 24-Nov was wrong. I still wasn't putting the UniqueID into the
	Private dict.
      <LI>
	I've been generating bad macbinary files since I started
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    I had not noticed that the resource and data fork must be padded to a multiple
	    of 128 bytes.
	    <UL>
	      <LI>
		This also meant that on rare occasions I would read them incorrectly too.
	    </UL>
	  <LI>
	    I was generating the crc incorrectly.
	</UL>
      <LI>
	Be a bit more vigorous about displaying filter text in file choosers.
      <LI>
	Default buttons didn't respond to the keypad enter key.
      <LI>
	Pressing OK in the character info dlg would often destroy the font's encoding
	event when it should not have.
      <LI>
	Was generating bad kerning tables for mac FONDs.
      <LI>
	Jim Killock reminds me that there was no way for pfaedit to read kerning
	data from a mac FOND. File-&gt;Merge Kern Data will now accept a mac resource
	file.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    15-Dec-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Add support for Big5HKSCS
      <LI>
	Redo CJK encodings
      <LI>
	Update cidmap files.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    14-Dec-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Add support for reading windows .FON and .FNT files.
      <LI>
	Add support for writing windows .FNT files. Sadly .FNT files aren't particularly
	useful. They need to be converted to .FON files with the resource editor
	somehow.
      <LI>
	Bug when reading postscript files that included complicated combinations
	of translate scale and concat commands.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit was a bit too cavalier about guessing how big serifs were. Caused
	problems when autokerning a fraktur font. (PfaEdit thought it had huge serifs
	when it had none).
      <LI>
	Direction (Clockwise, counterclockwise, correct) menu items are now greyed
	out if the selected path is open.
      <LI>
	New OpenVms patches from Jacob Jansen.
      <LI>
	Update unicode database to 3.2
    </UL>
  <LI>
    13-Dec-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit will now open a ttf/otf font that contains only bitmap strikes
      <LI>
	PfaEdit will now read NFNT resources (old mac bitmaps)
      <LI>
	PfaEdit will import NFNT resources
      <LI>
	Fixed a number of problems with loading and saving bdf files
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    Did not understand that the "ENCODING" keyword could take two values if the
	    first were -1
	  <LI>
	    Added unencoded glyphs at the wrong encoding (I know that sounds like an
	    oxymoron. I assign them an encoding, and I did it badly).
	  <LI>
	    If a font name were not one of the X Logical Font Names then pfaedit might
	    fail to give the font a familyname or a fontname. This caused more problems
	    when generating a new bdf file.
	</UL>
    </UL>
  <LI>
    11-Dec-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>

	char view.
      <LI>
	Took the width display off the info line and did it as hints are displayed.
      <LI>
	Menus now respond to Home and End key events.
      <LI>
	I have changed the calling conventions for the ExpandStroke scripting command
	to reflect the height ratio value that is now needed.
      <LI>
	Holding down the Alt (Meta) key when using the freehand tool will now close
	the path.
      <LI>
	The Generate Fonts dlg will now display an appropriate bitmap fontname if
	"No Outline Font" is selected.
      <LI>
	I think I've got the wacom stuff working now. FreeHand tool now takes options.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    08-Dec-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Oops. Can't use Alt-Shift for menus (it's treated as a mnemonic) use
	Alt-Ctl-Shift instead.
      <LI>
	Reorganized the prefs dlg.
      <LI>
	Made FontInfo non-modal.
      <LI>
	Added a default icon for all pfaedit's windows &amp; dlgs.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    06-Dec-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Fixed a problem where PfaEdit still picked bad fonts sometimes.
      <LI>
	Typo in format spec for character windows
      <LI>
	At Werner's suggestion:
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    The Transform dlg now preserves hints in the undo
	  <LI>
	    Added an indication of which layer was active
	  <LI>

	  <LI>
	    Added a Revert Glyph command
	  <LI>
	    The location of the advance width pops up on the info line when the cursor
	    moves over the advance width
	  <LI>
	    changed the Set Width command to get the right default value.
	  <LI>
	    There were some layout problems in the char info dlg.
	</UL>
      <LI>
	Redid the configuration for mac os/x. I've just upgraded to the new developers'
	tools and that fixed a lot of problems.
    </UL>
  <LI>

	Fixed a crash in menus, if the cursor was moved from a submenu (a cascaded
	menu) to the menubar without passing through the main menu then a crash would
	happen.
      <LI>
	Clicking in a menu above the first line will dismiss the menu.
      <LI>
	Fixed a crash when generating postscript fonts.
      <LI>
	Oops. Bug in work of 2-Dec. The character named "u" was treated as uXXXX
	and given unicode U+0000 rather than U+0075.
      <LI>
	It is now possible to switch between editing layers in the outline character
	view by using the mnemonics displayed in the layers palette (even if the
	layers palette is hidden).
	<P>
	Or by using the popup menu invoked by the third mouse button.
      <LI>
	Rewrote Expand Stroke so that the caligraphic pen is no longer treated as
	a line (it is now treated as a rectangle).
      <LI>
	Changed behavior of Next/Prev char so that they do not wrap in the outline
	character view. Also added the encoding to the title.
      <LI>
	In the outline view made a seperate menu entry for Char Info and removed
	it from "Get Info". Made Ctl-Shft-I invoke Char Info in all views (Ctl-I
	will also invoke it everywhere but the outline view).
      <LI>
	Undo will now attempt to reset the modified bit on a character. It will not
	attempt to reset the modified bit on the font as a whole (there are too many
	things that can change without setting undo info).

	If the fontview were only one line high PfaEdit would not scroll to the selected
	character properly.
      <LI>
	Adobe has released a new version of their glyph naming conventions. In particular
	they provide names for code points outside of the bmp. Danilo Sagan points
	out that they also allow for alternate glyph names. (specified in the
	<A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/type/otfdk/main.html">FDK</A>).
      <LI>
	Remove the PFAEDIT_PI1 environment variable.

	Harald Harders provides a patch to allow SetItalicAngle to deal with real
	numbers.
      <LI>
	Vadim Belman provides a patch to keep Element-&gt;MetaFont from crashing
	when applied to spaces.
      <LI>
	Bringing up the preference dlg would segfault if there were arguments specified
	for autotrace.
      <LI>
	Put in a hack so that the environment variable PFAEDIT_PI1 controls whether
	U+03D6 is named "pi1" (as Unicode suggests it ought to be) or "omega1" (as
	Adobe has said it should be).
      <LI>
	Follow riggle's suggestion and use the shell command "open" (on a Mac) to
	bring up a browser window.

	Harald Harders points out that UniqueID needs to be in both the font and
	the Private dictionaries in a PostScript font.
      <LI>
	And provides access to UniqueID from the scripting language.
      <LI>
	More fixes for TeX sfd files.

	Using Font Info to convert to SJIS didn't work.
      <LI>
	Merge fonts had problems when both fonts were CID keyed.
      <LI>
	Generate a unicode encoding subtable even when generating a CJK encoding
	subtable.
      <LI>
	Added a preference item to allow user to specify whether s/he would rather
	read in the unicode or the cjk encoding subtable.

	Two new tools in the outline character view.
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    A hand tool -- for scrolling around
	  <LI>
	    A freehand tool -- for having pfaedit try to fit splines to a hand drawn
	    curve
	</UL>
      <LI>
	MergeFonts was broken from scripts.
      <LI>
	New Russian UI from Valek.
      <LI>
	Another remove overlap fix from KANOU.
      <LI>
	Added code to invoke Internet Explorer (or an Mac App) on the Mac (so pressing
	F1 should actually load some help on the mac now).
      <LI>
	Fixed random crash in font generation dialog
      <LI>
	PS-&gt;TTF conversion tried to force splines in cases where it could not.
    </UL>

    <UL>
      <LI>
	Improved behavior of Remove Overlap. Fix inspired by Kanou.
      <LI>
	Added a "Find Intersections" command, a varient of remove overlap that stops
	after it finds the intersections. I think this half of the job has no major
	bugs.
      <LI>
	If a single point is in the clipboard, then PfaEdit will also export the
	clipboard as STRING, giving the coordinates of the point. This is to make
	it easier to refer to the point.

	KDE has the lovely habit of losing some resize events when in continuous
	resize mode. So I've tweaked the fontview resize code so that it is less
	dependent on individual events.
      <LI>
	Added a mode where the user can choose between whether the font shown in
	the fontview should be scaled so that the em fits in the space provided (this
	is the old behavior) or so that the bounding box does.
      <LI>
	Rewrote the knife tool so that it cuts at the end rather than as it goes
	along. I think this is easier to use.
      <LI>
	Bug in the generation of format=2 truetype encoding tables (used for CJK
	fonts).
