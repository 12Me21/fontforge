    <UL>
      <LI>
	Deleting a glyph class within a kerning by classes object caused a crash
      <LI>
	Added some support for palm bitmap fonts
      <LI>
	Replace with reference only replaced the first instance.
      <LI>
	The Options dlg behaved oddly with respect to Apple &amp; OpenType modes
      <LI>
	When given a glyph with conflicting hints for which the first contour contained
	no hints, then in type2 output the glyph was drawn at a strange offset from
	its correct position.
      <LI>
	When generating an opentype font from a script, and specifying flags, the
	round coordinates flag was ignored
      <LI>
	When generating a font from a script using the default flag setting, we would
	always generate afm/tfm/pfm files
      <LI>
	KANOU pointed out that the stroked font import glyph command only worked
	if multilayer set.
      <LI>
	Added a preview bitmap to eps files.
      <LI>
	In a bitmap only font the font metrics menu items behaved in unexpected ways
	(as if they referred to a postscript font rather than the bitmap fonts)
      <LI>
	Various fixes to make importing stroked eps files into stroked fonts work
	better.
      <LI>
	KANOU requests a preference item to turn off use of freetype in font view.
      <LI>
	Fix more rounding errors in remove overlap.
      <LI>
	Fix some problems in the routine which finds roots of an arbetrary quartic.
      <LI>
	The remove bump option of simplify could screw up memory.
      <LI>
	Remove overlap got unhappy about control points which caused a very tiny
	overlap between adjacent splines
      <LI>
	Redo from the fontview usually caused a crash.
      <LI>
	KANOU provides a MakeLine scripting command
      <LI>
	If TYPE3 (multilayer) was not enabled, there was a flow of control through
	a function which did not return anything.
      <LI>
	Recovery files did not contain multilayer marks which lead to strange behavior
	and crashes
      <LI>
	Converting a font to multilayer caused a crash if there were outline glyph
	windows open.
      <LI>
	Make the encoding for scripts be utf8 consistently
      <LI>
	Allow the scripting Export command to take a format spec
      <LI>
	Add support for reals to the scripting language
      <LI>
	NearlyHv{Cps,Lines} scripting commands erroneously complained about too many
	args
      <LI>
	ff had a bug when outputting otf contextual ligatures
      <LI>
	Fix various crashes and infinite loops involved in parsing bad font files.
      <LI>
	ff had problems with user defined encodings.
      <LI>
	Made ff work if the psuedo-type "real" was defined to be a double.
      <LI>
	the string += concattonation operator in scripting screwed up memory
      <LI>

	The font type detector could fail to notice an svg file as such if it began
	with a byte order character.
      <LI>
	Ord didn't do proper type checking on its second argument
    </UL>
  <LI>
    9-Feb-2005
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Use freetype's FT_Outline_Get_Bitmap to make freetype rasterize from our
	internal data structures. Use freetype by default for the fontview and
	metricsview (except in some cases).
      <LI>
	The bitmap dlg didn't work for multilayered fonts when told to use freetype
	to rasterize.
      <LI>
	If we had a contour nested inside another, and did an Overlap Exclude with
	the nested contour selected, then that contour was not excluded.
      <LI>
	The []Correct Direction check box when importing PostScript, didn't do anything.
	(or rather it did, but got overrulled later)
      <LI>
	In bitmap only fonts, bitmaps created without moving the width line would
	get lost.
      <LI>
	Added a scripting command "SelectByColor"
      <LI>
	Don't apply transformations to glyphs which aren't worth outputting
      <LI>
	Moving control points with the get point info command had problems in quadratic
	splines.
      <LI>
	When adding type42 support I broke multiple master support.
      <LI>
	Werner provided a patch to add a trailing newline to my type1 fonts.
      <LI>
	Support for PaintType==2 and stroked fonts.
      <LI>
	Various problems with the clustering command
      <LI>
	Oops, somehow a patch reverted and things didn't work on systems without
	iconv
      <LI>
	worked on a couple of other configuration problems for the mac
      <LI>
	Some people install libraries without headers. Be prepared.
      <LI>
	Uniscribe (MS unicode text layout routines) may ignore either the GPOS or
	the GSUB table depending on the script, and may even refuse to use the font
	at all if it doesn't have the right stuff in GPOS/GSUB. A Hebrew font must
	have both a GPOS and a GSUB. If it doesn't the font is not used. A latin
	font need not have either, but if it doesn't have GSUB then GPOS won't be
	used.
	<P>
	Sergey Malkin from MicroSoft tells me:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	  Each shaping engine in Uniscribe can decide on its requirements for layout
	  tables - some of them require both GSUB and GPOS, in some cases any table
	  present is enough, or it can work without any table.
	  <P>
	  Sometimes, purpose of the check is to determine if font is supporting particular
	  script - if required tables are not there font is just rejected by this shaping
	  engine. Sometimes, shaping engine can not just reject the font because there
	  are fonts using older shaping technologies we still have to support, so it
	  uses some logic when to fallback to legacy layout code.
	  <P>
	  In your case this is Hebrew, where both tables are required to use OpenType
	  processing. Arabic requires both tables too, Latin requires GSUB to execute
	  GPOS. But in general, if you have both tables you should be safe with any
	  script to get fully featured OpenType shaping.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>
	So the script sub-table of both GPOS/GSUB should contain all scripts used
	in either (rather than just the scripts used in the current one).
      <LI>
	The AddATT scripting command didn't understand Nested.
      <LI>
	Add a cli argument "-c" to introduce a scripting command in an argument.
      <LI>
	Someone ran ff on a solaris box without iconv. (Odd because iconv is there
	by default). FF ran fine (Odder, why didn't it demand the library?), but
	crashed when it tried to use a conversion which didn't exist.
      <LI>
	There's another ASCII map in Unicode (0xe0000-0xe007f).
      <LI>
	Allow user to supply their own OtherSubrs routines (Some people object to
	Adobe's copyright).
      <LI>
	Codes to handle identifying a loaded font by relative filespec didn't work.
      <LI>
	Change Add Extrema so that it only adds extrema if
	<OL>
	  <LI>
	    The spline length is &gt;= em_size/32
	  <LI>
	    The extremum is an extremum of the entire contour containing the spline.
	</OL>
	<P>
	(Behavior in the outline view when there is a selection remains the same.
	So if the endpoints of a spline are both selected then all local extrema
	will be added to that spline, no matter how long it may be).
      <LI>
	Patch by Ralf Stubner. Fonts without UniqueID had a bad syntax.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    17-Jan-2005
    <UL>
      <LI>
	CapsLock now makes the arrow keys scroll in the outline view
      <LI>
	We lost count of hints when generating type2 fonts in glyphs with references
	to something containing hints which did not overlap. If we were unlucky,
	&lt;new-cnt+7&gt;/8 was different than &lt;real-cnt+7&gt;/8 and we ended
	up with garbage in the charstring.
      <LI>
	Add a TeX table to contain TeX metrics.
      <LI>
	TFM output was wrong. the TFtoPL doc says "
      <LI>
	reencoding with original encoding could create a glyph table one too small
	resulting in writing/reading garbage and an eventual crash.
      <LI>
	KANOU fixed a couple of problems in reading glyph names from bdf fonts.
      <LI>
	KANOU needed to disambiguate between "Point" a unit of measurement and "Point"
	a geometric object.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    16-Jan-2005
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Added support for OpenType Device Tables (These allow you to add small
	corrections to things like kerning at a given point size. Often at small
	point sizes kerning and advance widths will round in such a way as to produce
	unpleasing results. Device tables allow you to correct for that).
      <LI>
	Add dialogs for kerning pairs and anchors to allow users to set device tables.
	Extend dlg for kerning classes for this.
      <LI>
	Neil Parker suggested a patch for panose values that didn't apply to latin
	fonts
      <LI>
	Doing a Get Info on a single point caused a crash on the mac
      <LI>
	Further attempts to improve spline approximation, underlying Merge &amp;
	Simplify commands
      <LI>
	Relaxed simplify's definition of parallel so it will merge a few more straight
	lines.
      <LI>
	Make the behavior of Simplify More consistant across font/outline view. Simplify
	More can now set the default behavior for future simplify commands.
      <LI>
	Provide a menu command to round to hundredths of a em-unit
      <LI>
	Add a new facility to cluster coordinates to the same value. Useful as a
	prepass to Remove Overlap.
      <LI>
	Bug reading ligature data from a tfm file
      <LI>
	Add support for GPOS 'size' feature. Create a 'size' pane of the fontinfo
	dlg
      <LI>
	Replace with Reference had an interesting flaw. Consider the open and closed
	bullet characters. If the (single) contour in closed bullet matched the outer
	contour in open bullet then it would replace it with a reference. But this
	is incorrect as the two contours of open bullet need to be treated as a unit.
      <LI>
	Could get a bad memory reference in the font view if the mouse were to extend
	the selection outside of the window.
      <LI>
	Add a scripting function to return whether a file exists.
      <LI>
	In a Type1 font, if a glyph had no conflicting hints (and no flex hints)
	and got put in a subroutine, then we'd get no hints at all.
      <LI>
	Be more willing to generate format12 cmap subtables (unicode, non-bmp tables)
    </UL>
  <LI>
    6-Jan-2005
    <UL>
      <LI>
	New Copyright message, etc. Get rid of pfaedit message.
      <LI>
	Simplify produced strange results on quadratic splines.
      <LI>
	Simplify had problems with tangent points
      <LI>
	Changing a point's type from a tangent to a curve usually had unexpected
	results.
      <LI>
	Add a warning message in remove overlap when user passes us two intersecting
	contours which are oriented in oposite directions. Unfortunately it also
	complains about some other things.
      <LI>
	The 18 Dec changes to remove overlap introduced an infinite loop in some
	rare cases. (When there is a gradient of 0 in distance function between two
	splines).
      <LI>
	In a conditional operator (like &amp;&amp; or ||) in scripting where the
	second operand was not evaluated and the second operand contained a procedure
	call, then ff would crash
      <LI>
	Tweaked the point info dialog to show small offsets better
      <LI>
	Tweaked the merge command to behave better when merging tiny spline segments
	(where the length of the spline segment is so small that it should just be
	treated as a zero length spline and its slope ignored).
      <LI>
	Added an "Invert selection" command to the outline view, from Yoshiki Hayashi
      <LI>
	Pasting from the font view did not clear a glyph's instructions.
      <LI>
	New version of AutoHint. I've removed Diagonal Stem hints and mimum distance
	hints for now.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    31-Dec-2004
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Ah, windows pfm files expect the metrics to be output in win latin encoding
	order, not in the encoding defined by the pfb file. (Actually there are other
	posibilities for encoding, but as none is documented, I must ignore them).
      <LI>
	ReplaceWithReference broke at some point
      <LI>
	Add an argument-pair to the ReplaceWithReference() scripting command to allow
	the user to specify the amount of error that will be accepted.
      <LI>
	When generating a Type1 font, if a glyph had a single reference to a glyph
	not in adobe encoding, and that glyph itself had a single reference (in adobe
	enc) and some splines, then ff would make a reference to the ref in adobe
	enc and ignore the splines.
      <LI>
	Upgrade to Adobe-Japan1-6
      <LI>
	Various fixes to svg output
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    export glyph to svg didn't work
	  <LI>
	    multilayered generation had problems
	</UL>
      <LI>
	Ghost hints could get outside a glyphs bounding box in a type2 font.
      <LI>
	The generated truetype unique id string had an off by one error in the month
      <LI>
	Add support for dashed lines in multilayered mode
      <LI>
	In Full Page Glyph printing, the glyph was offset slightly from where it
	should have been.
      <LI>
	Pasting a reference into a multi-layered font produced a very odd layer
      <LI>
	ff didn't update the metrics view if the user pasted the selection with the
	middle mouse button.
      <LI>
	if a character were not in the current encoding then ff would not display
	it in the metrics view (even if it were in the font)
      <LI>
	Make the behavior of control points at the ends of open paths more reasonable.
      <LI>
	The Point-&gt;Curve command did not adust control points correctly.
      <LI>
	The View-&gt;Display Substitutions had numerous problems.
      <LI>
	Fix several problems from unicode unification of accents. Many characters
	which are said to be based on cedilla actually use a comma, other characters
	said to be carons also use comma. Make the n-with-apostrophe character be
	treated as an accented letter.
      <LI>
	Werner points out that straight lines should generally not be simplified
	(as they will no longer be straight afterwards). Add this knowledge to the
	simplify command.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    18-Dec-2004
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Added a raster debugger wndow
      <LI>
	Each time debugger starts, remember what debug windows were open last time
	it was used.
      <LI>
	Constraining the pen tool did not do what I expected
      <LI>
	If a glyph was encoded twice (or more) in a font, and an opentype font (or
	perhaps a bitmap only sfnt) were generated, then any glyphs after the second
	encoding would have the wrong width (ie. there would be an extra entry in
	the horizontal metrics table corresponding to a (non-existant) copy of the
	doubly encoded glyph)
      <LI>
	If a type1 font never defined .notdef but used it at least twice it the Encoding
	vector, then ff would crash.
      <LI>
	Updated Japanese UI (by KANOU)
      <LI>
	Werner found some crashes related to calling isalnum (etc.) using an index
	outside of bmp.
      <LI>
	More changes (I hope improvements) to remove overlap
    </UL>
  <LI>
    13-Dec-2004
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Some fixes to the raster display of the debug window
      <LI>
	Conversion of cubic to quadratic had a rounding error introduced by -O2.
	Made it a bit more forgiving about rounding errors.
      <LI>
	Added two new buttons to the point info dialog to allow the user to walk
	around the current contour (Normally the Next button skips to the start of
	the next contour if you are at the end of the current one, the "Next On Contour"
	button returns to the first point on the contour)
      <LI>
	improve interpretation of some type3 fonts (including those produced by
	fontographer 4)
      <LI>
	patch by Yoshki Hayashi to fix mnemonic crash in layers palette
      <LI>
	Added a rand() scripting command
      <LI>
	Support backslash newline to break up lines in a scrpt
      <LI>
	The internal adobe standard encoding thought it was unicode causing strange
	effects
      <LI>
	Type3 fonts that set colour/grey didn't work
      <LI>
	Printing at 140pt tried printing 4 glyphs across although there was only
	room for 3
      <LI>
	At install tell pkg-config the verson of fontforge
    </UL>
  <LI>
    3-Dec-2004
    <UL>
      <LI>
	If a cff file contained unencoded glyphs then ff would crash when loading
	it.
      <LI>
	When converting from cubic to quadratic splines, ff would sometimes produce
	a line when it should have found a spline
      <LI>
	During debugging of a ttf glyph, show what rasterization would produce if
	the current splines were used (highlight pixels which change)
      <LI>
	The debugger windows didn't always say "&lt;empty&gt;" when they should have.
      <LI>
	The debugger would often crash the second time we closed its window
      <LI>
	Asking for the script (as latin, greek, cyrillic...) of ".notdef" caused
	us to look at unallocated memory.
      <LI>
	We weren't labelling control points in the debugger
      <LI>
	debugger and grid fitter for tt fonts showed curved splines as lines
      <LI>
	Kerning pairs did not get scaled when changing em-size
      <LI>
	Add a preference for turning off automatic gotos as the user types in the
	glyph window
      <LI>
	Add a command to the glyph window to toggle between the two most recent glyphs
	used in that window (a mini history)
      <LI>
	Improved the points debugger window to show
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    implied points
	  <LI>
	    whether a point is on or off the curve (normal or control)
	  <LI>
	    added a scroll bar
	</UL>
      <LI>
	Provide info on debugging points as mouse moves over them.
      <LI>
	Fix (an innocuous) reference to unallocated memory
      <LI>
	Added ability to insert an uninterpreted table into an SFNT
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    New preference item: PreserveTables which lists a comma seperated set of
	    table tags which are to be loaded from SFNT files without interpretation
	    (Note if ff thinks it understands a table it will parse it rather than preserving
	    it)
	  <LI>
	    Scripting command LoadTableFromFile("tag ","filename")
	  <LI>
	    Scripting command SaveTableToFile("tag ","filename")
	  <LI>
	    Scripting command RemovePreservedTable("tag ")

      <LI>
	Kevin Schoedel suggests a new scripting command DrawsSomething()
      <LI>
	Kevin Schoedel requests that PrintFont be able to print a string sample (as
	opposed to a sample file)
      <LI>
	Kevin Schoedel points out that type1 fonts stuffed into mac resource forks
	are to be read in resource order rather than file order (often the two are
	the same) and provides a patch to fix this.
      <LI>
	Change the way the default language/locale is picked in fontinfo-&gt;TTF
	Names
      <LI>
	Remember (across invocations) whether palettes should be hidden or not.
      <LI>
	Ignore NUL chars when reading PostScript strings (PS supports NULs in strings,
	I'm not going to bother, but I don't want to parse incorrectly because of
	them).
      <LI>
	ff lost the ability to Select("U+xxxx") or Select("=") from a script.
      <LI>
	Oops, the routine to read PostScript FontNames from a ttf file was broken
	by the encoding change.
      <LI>
	If a ttf file contained an erroneous composite glyph with flags indicating
	more components after the glyph had run out of data, then ff might attempt
	to read instructions also and have problems.
      <LI>
	If a font contains multiple ttf names for a given string in a language then
	allow the user to pick which one s/he likes best.
      <LI>
	Another case where a bad otf table crashes fontforge
      <LI>
	If a ttf/otf font does not contain a postscript FontName string in the name
	table, then ff's attempt to synthesize one out of fullname/familyname did
	not check for a valid name.

	If ff started without a prefs file, then creating a new font would crash

	If a copyright string contained a newline then ff would generate bad postscript
      <LI>
	If user added a comment to an empty glyph then the comment wasn't saved in
	the sfd file.
      <LI>
	If ff saved a utf7 string to an sfd file (ttf names, etc.) and that string
	contained a hyphen that followed immediately after something that needed
	to be encoded in base64, then the hyphen would be lost.
      <LI>
	new french UI
      <LI>
	ff was (usually) setting the ascent/descent fields of the 'hhea' table to
	0. When the font was drawn on the mac it was clipped to nothing.

	ff would crash on postscript fonts where the encoding included a glyph name
	not defined in CharStrings (probably broken on 12-Oct)
      <LI>
	More remove overlap work
      <LI>
	In the glyph window, when the scaled distance between the top and bottom
	of the window is less than 1 em-unit, then the vertical ruler was drawn with
	the top and bottom labels reversed.

	KANOU has a <A HREF="http://khdd.net/fontforge-jman/">Japanese version</A>
	of this reference manual under construction.
      <LI>
	In MultiLayered mode, the "New Layer" menu item left a dangling pointer which
	caused a crash if anyone looked at the background layer.
      <LI>
	In MultiLayered mode, if one clicked beyond the last layer in the Layers
	palette, ff would crash.
      <LI>
	KANOU provided a patch to fix another crash in the layers palette.
      <LI>
	KANOU has provided a new Japanese UI.
      <LI>
	Made an addition to CharInfo() scripting command so user can determine the
	horizontal extrema of a glyph at a given vertical position. Similar addition
	for vertical extrema at horizontal pos.
      <LI>

	I have redone the way ff handles encodings internally. We used to depend
	on the encodings builtin to gdraw/gunicode. Now we use iconv() (if there
	is no iconv, then ff will use a dummy iconv which understands the encodings
	of gdraw/gunicode). Encodings are identified by name rather than by number
	now.

	Added an extra argument to scripting RoundToInt, so that you can have control

	Used to complain if there were more than one Unique Font ID in the truetype
	'name' table. (because the OpenType list said there should only be one, else
	it would not be unique). But both Apple and MS ship with fonts containing
	multiple Unique Font IDs. God knows what that means, or when you pick one
	over the other... Anyway I changed my error into a warning.

	I have rewritten Remove Overlap from scratch. I seems less likely to crash,
	but I'm not sure that in any other respect it is improved.
      <LI>
	In the character view the Remove Overlap (and Intersect and Find Intersections)
	now only work on selected contours, or, if no contours are selected then
	on all contours. This change makes these commands consistant with most other
	commands in the character view, but it is a change from past behavior.
      <LI>
	The Import scripting command has been extended to give the user control over
	the stroking flags (correct direction, remove overlap, handle erasers). And
	the background flag has been extended a bit to apply to other things than
	bitmaps.
      <LI>
	ff had a pointer dangling to a freed block after loading a font containing
	multiple versions of some greek letters.
      <LI>
	U+1D400-U+1D7FF are stylized variants of the latin and greek alphabets as
	used in Mathematics. The font view will now display (in the glyph header)
	the proper variant of the glyph (assuming it can find a font with that style).
      <LI>
	The AMS (American Mathematical Society) has their own interpretation of the
	public use area. FF now understands their glyph names as alternates for those
	glyphs, and has an AMS interpretation (under FontInfo-&gt;Encoding) that
	will make ff use those names in new fonts.
      <LI>
	Many of code points in the AMS PUA are reencodings of other glyphs. FontForge
	will automatically generate these reencodings for you.
      <LI>
	The AMS also describes how some TeX glyph names map to unicode. So include
	those names in our alternate list too (so we can map them correctly, not
	as a way of encouraging people to use them).
      <LI>
	Both the AMS defn. of the PUA and the Big5 defn. map characters which are
	properly in other unicode planes into the BMP. FF now understands this, and
	converting between a BMP encoding and a full unicode encoding will move things
	from the PUA to their proper unicode slot in higher planes.

	Find Problems thought that adjacent splines intersected at their common

	In the char view, I used to blank out the status line when the mouse moved
	outside the window. But some of that info is still valid. So only blank out
	the meaningless bits.

	Kanou requests a disambiguation between two strings with the same label in

	Piska keeps complaining about the way ff handles 0 width strokes. He wants
	it to have zero width (disappear, I guess), but PS says it should be stroked
	as the thinnest line possible (not clear what this should mean in ff, I interpret
	it as a 1em-unit stroke). But METAPOST uses a 0 width stroke in cases where
	it wants no stroking (with a fill) so in the special case of a fill with
	a 0 width stroke, turn off stroking.
      <LI>
	Use a different approach to approximating a set of points with fixed slopes
	at the end points. Used to do least squares (fixup slopes), least squares
	again (fixup slopes). Now I do least squares (fixup slopes), perturb the
	lengths of the slope vectors until we find the best fit.
      <LI>
	I was generating flex hints when I should not have done so. Add a heuristic
	so that ff doesn't add flexes to small circles.
