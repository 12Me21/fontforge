<CODE>acorn2sfd [-version] [-help] {acorndir ...}</CODE>
<P>
<EM>acorn2sfd</EM> will take several Acorn RISC/OS font directories and convert
them into <A HREF="overview.html">PfaEdit</A>'s sfd files.
<P>
An Acorn RISC/OS font directory should contain two files, one named
<CODE>Outlines</CODE> and one named <CODE>Intmetrics</CODE> (the
<CODE>Intmetrics</CODE> file may be omitted, in which case the advance widths
will not be known). <I>acorn2sfd</I> will read both files and generate an
sfd file from them (which <A HREF="overview.html">PfaEdit</A> can turn into
TrueType or Postscript).
<P>
<CODE>-help</CODE> will provide a mini description and will list the available
options.
<P>
<CODE>-usage</CODE> will list the available options.
<P>
<CODE>-version</CODE> will display the current version of <EM>acorn2sfd</EM>
(a six digit string containing the date stamp of the source files).

<UL>
  <LI>
    Some Acorn fonts have different filenames (IntMetric0, Outlines0, etc.).
    <I>acorn2sfd</I> is stupid, and only looks for IntMetrics and Outlines, if
    yours are named something else, rename them.
  <LI>
    Acorn fonts use a different fill rule than either PostScript or TrueType.
    You should run Element-&gt;Correct Direction on the sfd file after converting
    it.
  <LI>
    The IntMetrics file for Trinity only seems to contain advance widths for
    the first 34 characters of the 416 in the font. In general Trinity does not
    conform well to the
    <A HREF="http://www.pinknoise.demon.co.uk/Docs/Arc/Fonts/Formats.html">documentation
    I've got</A>, so presumably I'm missing something and other fonts will probably
    be messed up too.
  <LI>
    Acorn fonts usually do not contain encoding data so <I>acorn2sfd</I> assumes
    iso-latin1 (or unicode for big fonts).
  <LI>
    Most Acorn fonts I've seen on the web are zipped up with a non-standard zip.
    Don't expect <I>acorn2sfd</I> to be able to unzip them.
  <LI>
    Acorn hinting data are lost.
  <LI>
    Acorn kerning data are currently lost.
