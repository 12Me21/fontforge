<UL>
  <LI>
    16-Apr-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	BDF fonts did not mark the missing (.notdef, undefined, etc.) character properly.
      <LI>
	otf fonts had the default and normative widths reversed on output
      <LI>
	Added marginally better support for non-latin ligatures in GPOS/GSUB tables.
      <LI>
	Added support for arabic forms in the GSUB table (ie. we now produce 'init',
	'medi', 'fina', and 'isol' features)
      <LI>
	Build composit should now note whether arabic ligatures are
	&lt;initial&gt;, &lt;final&gt;, &lt;medial&gt; or &lt;isolated&gt;
      <LI>
	It is now possible to have multiple font views looking at one font. I expect
	this will be a rich source of bugs, especially for CID keyed fonts.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    9-Apr-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Under KDE we could get two textfields flashing cursors (thinking they had
	focus) should be fixed.
      <LI>
	Added Undo/Redo to metricsview
      <LI>
	Added Undo/Redo to fontview
      <LI>
	Added Element menu to metricsview
      <LI>
	Added [Fix] button to (some of) Find Problems
    </UL>
  <LI>
    5-Apr-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Applied various patches from KANOU Hiroki
      <LI>
	Changes to metricsview
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    Fixed some minor bugs
	  <LI>
	    Double clicking on a character will open that character
	  <LI>
	    Enabled Copy/(CopyRef/CopyWidth/)Paste but not Cut
	</UL>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit had problems when there were exactly two X resources.
      <LI>
	Made the Point Info dlg wider.
      <LI>
	Improved printing text samples at large point sizes.
      <LI>
	I was generating flex hints incorrectly.
      <LI>
	Extended postscript interpretter slightly to recognize the eps files (called
	"art") produced by fontographer
      <LI>
	Additions to the scripting language
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    CenterInWidth
	  <LI>
	    AutoWidth (from Andreas P&aring;hlsson)
	  <LI>
	    AutoKern
	</UL>
      <LI>
	The Expand Stroke fix for 4-Mar-2001 was too extreme.
      <LI>
	Added a field to Char Info that shows the components out of which this character
	(accented, ligature, hangul sylable, etc.) may be built.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    3-Apr-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Various scrollbar enhancements
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    thumb now has a bigger minimum size
	  <LI>
	    fontview/charview both respond to page up and page down requests
	  <LI>
	    right mouse button may be used to position thumb
	</UL>
      <LI>
	Installed James A. Crippen makefile patch so that distclean reports success
	even if there are no files to clean.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit had problems guessing default ligatures for characters outside of
	BMP.
      <LI>
	In the outline character view, double clicking with one of the point tools
	(curve, corner, tangent, pen) will add a point and then bring up a
	<A HREF="getinfo.html">Point Info</A> dialog
      <LI>
	If you edit in a textfield (so that the mouse pointer vanishes) and then
	tabbed into another text field the mouse pointer would never reappear.
      <LI>
	Merge Fonts left memory in a bad state and would often cause a crash.
      <LI>
	Merge Fonts used a string for a title which was ascii when unicode was expected.
	This could cause strange characters to be displayed.
      <LI>
	More fixes for build accented characters (for inverted breve and Oslash).
    </UL>
  <LI>
    14-Mar-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Nifty. The modifier keys auto-repeat under cygwin (if Control is down one
	gets a series of Press/Release, Press/Release... while normal X just gives
	one Press.) This meant we'd keep refreshing the tools palette, which meant
	an annoying flicker and slowed things down.
      <LI>
	Raise the palettes after a resize
      <LI>
	PfaEdit didn't handle 8bit colormaps well. I've improved the behavior, and
	added an x resource to give the user some control over behavior.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    10-Mar-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Oops. I broke CID-keyed postscript input (ie. none-otf) when I added the
	6-Mar fix for type1utils
      <LI>
	Applied another patch from KANOU Hiroki, on otf cid support
    </UL>
  <LI>
    9-Mar-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	added docs for sfddiff.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    8-Mar-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Added a new program, <A HREF="sfddiff.html">sfddiff</A>, to compare fonts
	and show their differences.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    6-Mar-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Small change to the format of cidmap files (to bring names into conformance
	with adobe's spec on modifed unicode names), and corresponding changes to
	a few routines.
      <LI>
	Add support for the type1 format produced by GNU type1utils. Which is vaguely
	like that used by ghostview.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    4-Mar-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Fixed more problems with reading eps files (these were mostly within Expand
	Stroke, so presumably also problems with Element-&gt;Expand Stroke)
      <LI>
	And one more problem with the file chooser.
      <LI>
	Scripting additions:
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    Ability to generate a pfm file from script
	  <LI>
	    Ability to Merge Kerning Info from a script
	  <LI>

	Will now display something useful for rotated and italic cids
    </UL>
  <LI>
    3-Mar-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Fixed a number of problems involved in reading in eps files.
      <LI>
	28-Feb Mac work introduced a bug in the file picker dlg (in wildcarding).
    </UL>
  <LI>
    2-Mar-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Rounding errors could accumulate when generating Type1 fonts.
      <LI>
	Fix for some overlap problems due to KANOU Hiroki
      <LI>
	If PfaEdit crashed (or was interrupted) after making some (unsaved) changes
	to a font, and that font was subsequently deleted, the PfaEdit's autorecovery
	would complain about a missing file each time it was started. Now it will
	notice the problem and ask whether it should delete the recovery file (whereupon
	it will stop complaining).
      <LI>
	Enabled a fix from Greg Ford so that PfaEdit set the mac style bits
	appropriately.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    28-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	When running under Mac OS/X PfaEdit is now able to open/create mac resource
	forks
      <LI>
	I may have fixed a bug displaying images on solaris screens with bit depth
	8
      <LI>
	Cleaned up a problem with the postscript name table (in a ttf file) when
	there was a .notdef character
      <LI>
	Fixed some problems with references when reading in truetype.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    24-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Substr() did not work when given three arguments
      <LI>
	Added
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    $bitmaps (returns an array of all bitmap sizes rasterized for the current
	    font)
	  <LI>
	    BitmapsAvail()
	  <LI>
	    BitmapsRegen()
	</UL>
      <LI>
	Changed the FontInfo dlg to give direct access to the postscript names rather
	than trying to build the fontname out of family and modifiers.
      <LI>
	Added the ability to create an encoding which is any given plane of unicode
	(ie BMP is plane 0, SMP is plane 1, SIP is plane 2...)
      <LI>
	Fixed a bug in Revert
      <LI>
	More work on hints. 
	  <HR>
      <LI>
	Build Composit will now build a dotlessi from an "i" (and same for dotlessj)
    </UL>
  <LI>
    20-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Made Shift-Arrow keys move along italic axis.
      <LI>

    </UL>
  <LI>
    19-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Bugs in the generation of MacRoman encoding tables in ttf output (introduced
	14-Feb)
      <LI>
	The Goto Dlg sometimes didn't notice Returns (ie. OK button wasn't always
	invoked)
      <LI>
	Some linear splines were not noticed as such.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    18-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Cancelling the Point Info dlg would leave minimum distance hints in a bad
	state.
      <LI>
	Using Undo also left the MD hints wonky
      <LI>
	added $fontchanged to scripting
      <LI>
	Added SaveAll menu item in font view.
      <LI>
	Sometimes the underlines for accelerators didn't print in the menu (depended
	on what PfaEdit thought the screen resolution was).
      <LI>
	Added a new minimum distance hint for serifs of diagonal stems.
      <LI>
	Fixed a bug where some extra serif stems were hinted.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    16-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Created a "Select" submenu of the edit menu in the outline view. Moved
	Edit-&gt;Select All, View-&gt;Next Point, View-&gt;Prev Point into it.
      <LI>
	Added Deselect All, Select Next Control Point, Select Prev Control Point,
	Select First Point, Select Width, Select VWidth
      <LI>
	It is now possible to select the width (right bearing) line and move it with
	the arrow keys or transform dlg (or to move points and the width line
	concurrently). VWidth too.
      <LI>
	Added variables with global and font scope to Scripting.
      <LI>
	Yet another bug in the new simplify/merge code
      <LI>
	Cleaned up unicode range names a bit more. 
	  <HR>
      <LI>
	Changed the Goto Character dialog so that it will now (for two/four byte
	encodings) display a list of unicode ranges which are in the font and allow
	you to go to a range by name.
      <LI>
	Made it possible to copy and paste the left and right side bearings (from
	menus and scripts)
    </UL>
  <LI>
    14-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	My TrueType parser will now read cmap subtable formats 8,10 and 12 (the 4
	byte encoding tables) and will produce format 12 subtables for full unicode
	fonts.
      <LI>
	Cleaned up various encoding problems.
      <LI>
	Fixed display of SJIS.
      <LI>

	was untranslated.
      <LI>
	The arrow keys can be used to move a control point.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    12-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Added sjis and Wansung encodings
      <LI>
	Used freetype for a couple of other things (generating gdf files and exporting
	bitmaps)
      <LI>
	Textfields didn't respond to middle button clicks (to paste the primary
	selection).
      <LI>
	PfaEdit would sometimes fail to exit properly if you brought up a script
	dlg.
      <LI>
	Added a --version command line option.
      <LI>
	Fixed another bug in generating postscript.
      <LI>
	Added a user defined print command option to the print dlg.
      <LI>

      <LI>
	Fixed a bug in loading integer resources
      <LI>
	Cleaned up the help command line option.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    9-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit will now use freetype (if available) to generate bitmaps for the
	fonts (results are much better).<BR>
	It still does its own rasterizing for the fontview (there's a lot of overhead
	involved with freetype, and this needs to be fastish)
      <LI>
	Made the Generate Font dlg settings sticky across invocations of pfaedit.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    8-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit would crash when generating a PostScript font from ARIAL.TTF.
      <LI>
	Changed the bitmap dlgs so that they allow you to specify some control over
	interesting screen resolutions. (before just support X standard res. of 75
	and 100, now support MS 96&amp;120 and Mac 72).
      <LI>
	Oops, Apple now documents that the bdat and bloc tables should have version
	number 0x20000. But when I last looked it said 0x10000 and that didn't work.
      <LI>
	Put the docs in their own rpm file.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    7-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	I think I've figured out how Apple does asian bitmaps now. They don't use
	NFNTs at all (or they do, but those NFNT are tiny stubs with no real data
	in them). All the data are in the sfnt. I should produce them properly now.<BR>
	-- Except I don't.
      <LI>
	I've also added the ability to create bitmap only sfnts for the mac.<BR>
	-- Which also isn't recognized by the mac.
      <LI>
	Made it possible for scripts to generate bitmaps without generating an outline
	font
      <LI>
	Fixed some problems loading bitmaps from ttf files.
      <LI>
	Fixed some problems loading bitmaps from anything...
      <LI>
	Allowed importation of eps files from the font view (to the extent that I
	can parse eps files, that is)
      <LI>
	Oops, scripting didn't support importation of pcf files.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    5-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Sometimes popup windows (tool tips) would show up with nothing in them. That
	should be fixed now.
      <LI>
	Added icons for pcf files
      <LI>
	Started work on 32 bit unicode.
      <LI>
	Oops. Scripting handled the caligraphic pen angle incorrectly.
      <LI>
	Put something into the about box.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    4-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Oops. PfaEdit was misusing the type1 "seac" command in some cases. I had
	not realized that the character being built needed to have the same width
	as the base (non-accent) character. This has been fixed.
      <LI>
	When using the charinfo dlg to change the name of a char, and that name was
	in use, and you cancelled the dlg after being warned about it then PfaEdit
	would crash (it would muck up memory).
      <LI>
	PfaEdit wasn't always calling subroutines (in postscript) when a character
	was in a subr.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit will now read in X11 pcf font files (they can be compressed, if so
	PfaEdit will decompress them first).
      <LI>
	Bug in wildcard processing for file chooser window.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    1-Feb-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Nifty! SUSE ships some greek (bitmap) fonts with iso8859-1 encodings rather
	than iso8859-7. PfaEdit is now alert and when it sees a bitmap font with
	foundary "greek" and encoding "iso8859-1" it will pretend it has encoding
	"iso8859-7".
      <LI>
	PfaEdit got confused by some fonts produced by type1fix.pl. Should be fixed.
      <LI>
	Build Composit Characters will now check the user defined ligature string
	to see what characters to use to build a ligature.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    31-Jan-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Conversion tables between JIS0201 (Katakana) and Unicode were wrong. KANOU
	Hiroki provided correct ones.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    30-Jan-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Oops. I'd left diagonal stems enabled in ttf generation. Caused problems.
	Disabled now.
      <LI>
	More work on accented characters.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    29-Jan-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Sped up background image drawing (finally)
    </UL>

	    AskUser
	  <LI>
	    Error
	</UL>
      <LI>
	Added a menu of commonly used scripts which the user can specify with the
	preference dlg.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    25-Jan-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Oops. Generate command in scripting language only generated pfb fonts
      <LI>
	PfaEdit would get confused if it loaded a font from a script when running
	with windows. Eventually it would crash, but perhaps not until you exited.
      <LI>
	Added
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    $italicangle
	  <LI>
	    $cidfontname, $cidfamilyname, $cidfullname
	  <LI>
	    $weight, $copyright
	  <LI>

	  <LI>
	    SetItalicAngle
	</UL>
      <LI>
	Removed $cidname (replaced with $cidfontname)
      <LI>
	Added a Call... button to the execute script dlg to allow you to insert a
	call to a script file easily
    </UL>
  <LI>
    24-Jan-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Added a way to scale dlgs in different languages.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    23-Jan-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Fixed a crash in merge (caused by selecting all points on a path and merging
	it (to remove the path))
      <LI>
	Improved positioning of ogonek and cedilla accents in Build Accented Character
    </UL>

  <LI>
    21-Jan-2002
    <UL>

      <LI>
	Added a Set Width command to the bitmap view IF there is no outline font.
      <LI>
	Added a menu item to invoke a script
      <LI>
	Added a "Comment" field to FontInfo. This does not correspond to any postscript
	or truetype entity. It is to be used for a changelog within the sfd file
	(or something similar).
    </UL>
  <LI>
    19-Jan-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Initial version of <A HREF="scripting.html">scripting</A>.
      <LI>
	Optimizer caused rounding errors which caused test for divide by zero to
	fail leading to errors in Simplify and Merge commands.
      <LI>
	bdf fonts with an encoding which did not itself include "-1" (or similar)
	failed to get the implied "-0" added.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    17-Jan-2002
    <UL>
      <LI>
	PfaEdit used to crash (sometimes anyway) if a list popup were active when
	a window was destroyed.
      <LI>
	TextFields within tabsets (like Font Info) responded to some events twice.
      <LI>
	Bug in the new TTF hinting routines could cause a crash (and did cause glyph
	programs which were erroneous)
      <LI>
	Crash caused by long names in /etc/passwd when creating a new font
      <LI>
	Redid fontname handling in Font Info dlg to allow URW names to pass through
	unscathed

	    Only updates the fullname (human readable name) if it were previously in
	    sync
	  <LI>
	    Recognize "-" as starting the modifiers rather than trying to find the end
	    of the family name

	    If you don't change the family or the modifiers then pfaedit will now leave
	    the fontname untouched
	</UL>
    </UL>
  <LI>
    14 Jan 2002

	Added two new concepts to hinting which only apply to truetype:
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    You can specify that a certain point should be rounded to the grid in x or
	    y<BR>
	    (note: points on hints don't need this, they'll always be rounded)
	  <LI>
	    You can specify that the x or y distance between two points should never
	    vanish (this is called Minimum Distance)<BR>
	    (note: each hint implies one of these going from one side of the hint to
	    the other, also there is an implied one of these between any two non-overlapping
	    hints)<BR>
	    You can also specify that the distance between a point and the width should
	    never vanish. This means that there will always be at least one pixel between
	    that point and the advance width of the character.
	</UL>
      <LI>
	I removed the serif checker from the ttf instruction generator and moved
	it to the autohinter (with some changes of course) and it now generates minimum
	distances.
      <LI>
	I added a minimum distance between the last stem of a character and the width.
      <LI>
	I added a user interface to display and control these

	I realized I was misinterpretting the ttf docs (again) and that IUP worked
	better than I thought, and so I removed my own interpolation code (thank
	you freetype! it is so good to see what the instructions do.)
      <LI>
	Cleaned up some rather technical issues in the truetype instruction generation
	occasioned by non-overlapping and non-intersecting hints.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit will now read (but not produce) '.gsf' files. These are yet another
	postscript format, like a pfa but without the eexec encoding. Ghostscript
	uses them (others may, I think Wadalab did...).
      <LI>
	Oops. In encodings containing characters with no defined postscript unicode
	names, then the name generated for an unused character was wrong.
      <LI>
	Oops. PfaEdit thought all user defined encodings were two byte encodings
	and produced a warning message for them when generating type1 fonts.
      <LI>
	Added a force encoding flag to the Font Info dlg. This is for those cases
	where PfaEdit reads in a font but can't figure out what the proper encoding
	is, then doing a force encoding will simply rename all the characters to
	match what they should be in the chosen encoding.

	    fourth...) point moved by the wrong amount.
	  <LI>
	    Points that weren't on any hints were often not interpolated properly.
	  <LI>
	    The serif code picked up on things which weren't serifs and tried to hint
	    them as though they were.
	</UL>

	TTF spline approximation (cubic-&gt;quadratic) should be twice as fast.
      <LI>
	Clearing/Cutting a character with references from the font view corrupted
	PfaEdit's internal state. If this were followed by a reduction in the number
	of characters in the font (Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;Encoding) a crash could
	occur.

	Hmm. Apple has some very strange things to say about how offsets and scaling
	factors overlap in compound ttf glyphs. It is not well enough described (at
	least when it applies to rotations) for me to implement it. Microsoft doesn't
	do this. Great. OpenType gives a pair of bits to control this behavior (bit
	11 set do it apple's way, bit 12 set do it MS way, neither set flip a coin
	and guess, both set die in horrible agony). But still no description of exactly
	what Apple does. So I've changed my ttf output routine always to set bit
	12 in the composit flags. And the read in does something if it gets the apple
	bit. Probably not the right thing though.

	Selecting by dragging out a rectangle in the character outline view would
	sometimes miss points. I think that's fixed.
      <LI>
	Doing a multi-character copy in the fontview would remove non-existant characters
	from the copy set. They are no longer removed.
      <LI>
	Build Accented character would always use a dotlessi when building an character
	based on an "i". This behavior is only correct if the accent added is above
	the letter. Adding an ogonek for example should retain the dot. This is now
	fixed. (In theory the same problem could occur for j, but I don't think there
	are any cases where it does).
      <LI>
	When generating a type1 font PfaEdit will detect whether Flex hints can be
	used and use them if appropriate.

	There was a bug in the routine that read in flex hints. It would leave behind
	6 extra points not on any path in most characters with a flex hint. These
	points were not harmful, but they should not have been there.

	PfaEdit no longer crashes on high-end systems where the default visual has
	a smaller depth than the maximum the screen supports.
      <LI>
	PfaEdit no longer crashes on systems with no bitmap unicode fonts installed.
      <LI>
	When PfaEdit reads in a Type1 font it will preserve the original character
	strings (the type1 strings that define the glyph shape) and will write them
	out again when you save the font. If you modify a character (even something
	innocuous like setting the width) the string for that character will be lost.
	This means that any characters you do not modify will retain flex hints and
	hint substitution. (the Subrs and OtherSubrs arrays are also preserved).
      <LI>
	There is now a way to edit the entries in the Private dictionary (well most
	of them. No way to edit the Subrs entry). The program will guess at good
	values for some entries (like StdHW or BlueValues). If there is no BlueValues
	entry present when a type1 font is generated then the program will guess
	at good values (and will also guess at values for OtherBlues), otherwise
	it will use the one supplied. Similarly for StdHW and StdVW (if StdHW is
	absent then the program will guess at SnapStemH too, similarly for SnapStemV).
	If UniqueID is present in the Private dictionary then that value will be
	used in the font dictionary, if no UniqueID is present then the program will
	generate a random number in the allowed range.
