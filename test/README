This is a minimal testsuite for pfaedit. I expect it will grow with time.

You can execute the tests by:
  $ <testdir>/runtests <pfaedit>
(where <testdir> is the directory of the testsuite, and <pfaedit> is the
 pathspec of the pfaedit program)

Before you execute any of the tests you must download the test fonts.
I do not provide these because most of them aren't my work. If you can't find
one of the requisit fonts, simply comment out the tests which use it.

These fonts must be placed in <testdir>/fonts/
