I appologize for the roughness of this process, this is all new stuff and it's
nowhere near finished. Eventually this will all get rolled into the pfaedit
distribution, but not yet.

BUILDING
    First you must download and build pfaedit (or at least libg{draw,unicode})
	http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net/
    Then you should download, build and install libfreetype
	http://freetype.sourceforge.net/
    Then download the ttfmod_src package and put it in the same directory
     whence you gunziped the libraries, gunzip it, then:
	$ cd pfaedit
	$ configure.ttfmod
	$ cd ttfmod
	$ make
    Note that the configure script is called "configure.ttfmod".

INSTALLING
    Er, I'm not really sure of the best way to do this. If you su root (or
    	anyone else with write access to /usr/) and type
	$ cp ttfmod /usr/bin/
	$ mkdir -p /usr/share/ttfmod
	$ cp *.ui /usr/share/ttfmod/

Please report any bugs to

Documentation is at:
	http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net/TtfMod/index.html
(not that there's much of it)
