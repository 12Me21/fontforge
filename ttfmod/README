I appologize for the roughness of this process, this is all new stuff and it's
not completely finished.

BUILDING
    First you must download and build pfaedit (or at least libg{draw,unicode})
	http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net/
    Then you should download, build and install libfreetype
	http://freetype.sourceforge.net/
    Then download the ttfmod_src package and put it in the same directory
     whence you gunziped the libraries, gunzip it, then:
	$ cd pfaedit/ttfmod
	$ make

INSTALLING
    Er, I'm not really sure of the best way to do this. If you su root (or
    	anyone else with write access to /usr/) and type
	$ cp ttfmod /usr/bin/
	$ mkdir -p /usr/share/ttfmod
	$ cp *.ui /usr/share/ttfmod/

Please report any bugs to
	gww@silcom.com

Documentation is at:
	http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net/TtfMod/index.html
(not that there's much of it)
