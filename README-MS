BEFORE INSTALLATION
 To run pfaedit under MS Windows you must first download the cygwin environment
 and probably the X windows package (of cygwin) as well.
 Look at
 	http://www.cygwin.com/
 and download the setup.exe program from there.
 run setup.exe
 it will ask you what components of cygwin you wish to install
 You will definitely need the base components, and you almost certainly want
  the X windowing system too.

 It is possible to use pfaedit without X, but in this case there is no user
 interface and you are limited to running scripts.

INSTALLATION NOTES:
    Download the appropriate binary from
    	http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net/index.html#binary
    If it is a .tgz file then it should contain
	A README file or two
	pfaedit.exe  -- the executable
	pfaedit.1    --	the man page.
	pfaedit-*.ui --	various user interface string files for different
			languages
    You should:
	$ gunzip pfaedit_cygwin-*.tgz; tar xf pfaedit_cygwin-*.tar
	$ mkdir -p /usr/local/bin /usr/local/man/man1 /usr/local/share/pfaedit
	$ mv pfaedit /usr/local/bin
	$ mv pfaedit.1 /usr/local/man/man1
	$ mv *.ui /usr/local/share/pfaedit

    You may need to add /usr/local/bin to your PATH environment variable (and
    /usr/local/man to your MANPATH environment variable)
    If your shell is bash then edit your ~/.bashrc and add
    	PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/bin
	MANPATH=${MANPATH:-}:/usr/local/man ; export MANPATH

RUNNING
 Before running PfaEdit you must start X. Just start a cygwin shell and type
 	$ xinit
 in it. This will bring up a big window that convers the screen (this is X's
 root window) and a smaller window inside it (this is called an xterm).
 Move the mouse into that window and type
 	$ twm
 After this you can start pfaedit...

$ pfaedit -new
 Creates a new font
$ pfaedit -nosplash
 (No splash screen in case you have a very slow X connection)
$ pfaedit font.pfa font2.pfb font3.ttf font4.otf font4.sfd
 Opens those fonts (sfd files are pfaedit's own spline font database files)
$ pfaedit
 Brings up a file picker dlg.
$ pfaedit -script script-file [script arguments]
 Starts pfaedit up without bringing up any windows. It will run the script-file
 (passing it any other arguments given on the command line) and then exit.

BUILDING
    Just download the file pfaedit_full-*.tgz which you will find on
	http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net/index.html#source
    Move it somewhere appropriate (/usr/local/src perhaps?) and type:
	$ gunzip pfaedit_full-*.tgz ; tar xf pfaedit_full-*.tar
	$ cd pfaedit
	$ configure.static
	$ make
	$ su
	# make install

More complex installations
    "make install" will also install a few other things which are not part of
    the standard package, but which are useful for some people.
    CIDMAPS:
	If you are going to be editing CID keyed fonts you should also down-
	load my cidmap files from
		http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net/cidmaps.tgz
	put that file in the same place as you put pfaedit_full*.tgz, then
	    $ mkdir -p pfaedit/cidmaps
	    $ mv cidmaps.tgz pfaedit/cidmaps
	    $ cd pfaedit/cidmaps
	    $ gunzip *.tgz ; tar xf *.tar
	    $ cd ../..
	And then proceed to do the normal install.
    DOCUMENTATION:
	You can choose to install PfaEdit's documentation on your system, then
	pressing the [Help] or [F1] key within PfaEdit will go to the local
	docs rather than those on the web.
	Download the doc bundle from
	    http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net/index.html#docs
	Then (assuming you have not changed the install prefix)
	    # mkdir -p /usr/local/share/doc/pfaedit
	    # mv pfaedit_htdocs-*.tgz /usr/local/share/doc/pfaedit
	    # cd /usr/local/share/doc/pfaedit
	    # gunzip *.tgz; tar xf *.tar

DEPENDENCIES
 PfaEdit has more functionality if libpng and libungif are installed on your
 system. If they are not then you can find them at:
     http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
	 http://www.gzip.org/zlib/
     ttp://prtr-13.ucsc.edu/~badger/software/libungif/index.shtml

 PfaEdit also makes use of libuninameslist to be found at:
     http://libuninameslist.sf.net/

 PfaEdit's truetype debugger is completely dependent on:
     http://freetype.sf.net/
 The default configuration is useful to PfaEdit, but more functionality
 is obtained if you enable the bytecode interpreter (but note: you must
 have a license from Apple to do this). Instructions for doing so are
 in the file README.UNX in the freetype distribution.
 *** PfaEdit also needs to have the freetype sources available to it      ***
 *** when it builds (it needs some internal include files). The configure ***
 *** script can usually figure this out, but it is very time-consuming    ***
 *** you might want to say $ ./configure --with-freetype-src=<dir>	  ***
 *** where <dir> is the top-level freetype source directory		  ***

 Finally, if you want to do autotracing you should install
     http://sourceforge.net/projects/autotrace/

BUILDING without X11
    PfaEdit can be built without X11. You will probably only want to do this
    if your system lacks X (in which case configure should figure that out and
    do it automagically). But if, for some strange reason you wish to build a
    non-X version on a machine with X type:
	$ configure --without-x
