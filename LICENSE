FontForge Licenses
------------------

FontForge is a free software project available as a whole project under
the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL), version 3 or later.

FontForge is a full-featured font editor which supports all common font
formats. FontForge (known from 2000 to 2004 as PfaEdit) was written and
developed primarily by George Williams from 2000 until 2011, published
as free software, and distributed under the 3-clause BSD license. Later,
when development slowed down and appeared to stop, in 2012 the FontForge
community began to take an interest in improving FontForge further with
fixes, modifications, libraries, patches, and other additions which have
been introduced under the same, or different, yet, compatible licenses.

How To License Contributions
----------------------------

The majority of FontForge was written by George Williams and published
under the revised BSD license. This license is permitted to be compiled
with added GNU GPL source code to build a FontForge executable program.

The reason for choosing this direction in licensing is because there are
many other libraries and files available under copyleft libre licenses,
such as LGPL and GPL. For example, Pango and Cairo are available under
the LGPL, and gnulib is available under the GPL.

Contributions to existing files must be made under the existing license
for that file. Contributions of new files should be made under a license
compatible with FontForge or a license compatible with the GPLv3.
