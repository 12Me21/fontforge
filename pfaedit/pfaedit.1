.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
allows you to create and modify PostScript and TrueType fonts. You can save fonts in
several different PostScript formats as well as TrueType, OpenType and CID-keyed fonts.
It will also generate bitmaps.
.Pp
If the
.Fl new
flag is specified, a new PostScript font with the ISO 8859-1 encoding (the
international encoding standard for western Europe, and the
standard for most X fonts) will be created.
.Pp
If the
.Fl recover
flag is specified, you can control PfaEdit's crash recovery mechanism \(em just
in case the crash recovery itself causes problems. -recover=none will not attempt
to recover from crashes on this run, while -recover=clean will delete any
recovery information.
.Pp
If the
.Fl script
flag is specified then the following argument will be treated as the filename
of a script file, which will be executed.
.Nm will not open the X display
and it will pass any other command line arguments to the script file.
.Pp
.Fl help
will list the available options and fork off a browser looking at the online
documentation. If you have installed the docs locally it will search for them
in /usr/share/doc/pfaedit (or whatever other location was compiled in), if not
it will search for them online.
.Pp
.Fl usage
will list the available options.
.Pp
.Fl version
will display the current version of
.Nm
(a six digit string containing
the date stamp of the source files).
.Pp
.Fl nosplash
will not display the splash screen.
.Pp
The
.Fl display 
flag must be followed by a display-name argument (localhost:0) and allows you
to specify the display.
.Pp
The
.Fl depth 
flag must be followed by an integer specifing a pixel depth supported by the
current X server.
.Nm
will attempt to find a visual that matches this depth, and if found will use it.
.Pp
The
.Fl vc 
flag must be followed by either the name of a visual class or an integer enumerating
a visual class.
.Nm
will attempt to find a visual that matches this class, and if found will use it.
.Pp
The
.Fl cmap 
flag must be followed by one of the strings: "Current", "Copy", or "Private".
It gives the user some control over how colormaps are handled on 8bit screens.
If you select "Current",
.Nm
will attempt to allocate its colors in the current (shared) colormap. It probably
won't get everything it wants. If you specify "Copy" then
.Nm
will allocate what it can and then copy the current colormap. This means it can
make use of cells other programs are using. If you specify "Private" then
.Nm
will create a new colormap and fill it up with exactly what it likes.
.Nm
will attempt to find a visual that matches this depth, and if found will use it.
.Pp
.Fl sync
flag will make X synchronous. This is mostly for debugging. It slows X down.
.Pp
The
.Fl keyboard 
flag must be followed by one of the keywords "ibm", "mac", "sun" or "ppc".
If specified
.Nm
will alter its menus to display modifier keys appropriate for that system. (ppc
assumes you have a mac keyboard and are running SuSe linux. The mappings are
different from those used by X on Mac OS/X. Annoying).
.Pp
If a
.Ar fontname
is given,
.Nm
will open a font view looking at each font you selected. This may be a binary
or ascii PostScript type1 font (.pfa or .pfb extensions) or one of pfaedit's
spline font database files (.sfd extension), or even a PostScript type 0 font
(.ps extension, though the encoding will probably be lost here), a true type
font (.ttf), an opentype font (.otf), a CID-keyed font (.cid, .otf) or a bitmap font (.bdf).
.Pp
Without flags or arguments,
.Nm
will open a file picker dialog and allow you to browse your disk to find the
appropriate font file, or create a new one.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The program
.I pfaedit
allows you to create and modify font files,
accepting input in the following formats
(with associated file extensions appearing in parentheses):
.TP
Glyph Bitmap Distribution (.bdf)
.TP
Macintosh resource fonts (.dfont, .bin, .hqx)
.TP
OpenType (.otf)
.TP
.IR pfaedit "spline font database (.sfd)"
.TP
\*(Ps, which includes:
.RS
.TP
ASCII format (.pfa)
.TP
Binary format (.pfb)
.TP
Open type format (.otf)
.TP
CID-keyed fonts, Adobe convention used primarily for Asian characters (.cid, .otf)
.TP
\*(Ps Type 0 (.ps)
.TP
\*(Ps Type 3 (.ps)
.RE
.TP
TeX bitmap (.pk)
.TP
TrueType (.ttf, .ttc)
.TP
X11 bitmap (.pcf)
.LP
If the argument list contains a font file name (or several),
.I pfaedit
opens a
.B fontview
window for each font displaying the characters of the that font.
In the absence of options or arguments,
the program opens a file-picker window,
allowing you to browse your disk to find a font file,
or create a new one.
.LP
This manual page is intended only as a rudimentary overview;
see the HTML Users Manual for fuller information.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-cmap maptype 
Employ the specified method to control 8-bit colormaps,
where
.I maptype
assumes one of these three values:
.RS
.TP
.B current
Attempt to allocate colors in the current (shared) colormap.
The program will likely not find everything it requires.
.TP
.B copy
Allocate what can be allocated, then copy the current colormap;
it can thus make use of cells other programs are using.
.TP
.B private
Create a new colormap and fill it with the required colors.
.RE
.TP
.BI \-depth " pixeld" 
Attempt to employ a visual that matches the specified pixel depth,
.IR pixeld .
.TP
.BI \-display " str" 
Employ the X display specified by the string
.I str
(for example: localhost:0).
.TP
.B \-help
Display the usage description
and start a web client displaying the online documentation.
.TP
.BI \-keyboard " ktype" 
Alter the displayed menus to employ modifier keys appropriate
to the specified keyboard type,
where
.I ktype
assumes one of the following four values:
.RS
.TP
.B ibm
IBM PC type keyboard.
.TP
.B mac
Apple Macintosh keyboard.
.TP
.B sun
Sun workstation keyboard.
.TP
.B ppc
Macintosh keyboard, but on a system running SuSe linux
(the mappings differ from those used under MacOS X).
.RE
.TP
.B \-new
Create a new font with the ISO 8859-1 encoding
(the international encoding standard for western Europe,
and the standard for most X fonts).
.TP
.B \-nosplash
Suppress display of the splash screen.
.TP
.BI \-recover " mode"
Control the crash recovery mechanism
(helpful if crash recovery causes problems),
where
.I mode
takes on one of three allowed settings:
.RS
.TP
.B auto
perform automatic recovery (default) if the program crashed before saving changes.
.TP
.B clean
Delete recovery information.
.TP
.B none
Suppress crash recovery.
.RE
.TP
.BI \-script " file"
Execute the script named
.IR file .
Does not open the X display.
Any other command line arguments will be passed to the script.
The program contains a command interpreter which allows access to
most but not all of its interactive features.
If a scriptfile is executable, and if its first line contains
the string "pfaedit", then the argument
.BI \-script
may be omitted. This means that pfaedit can be used as an interpreter.
.TP
.B \-sync
Make X synchronous.
Used primarily for debugging, this option slows X down.
.TP
.B \-usage
Display the usage description.
.TP
.B \-vc vclass 
Attempt to use a visual that matches the class,
.IR vclass ,
specified as either the name of a visual class
or an integer enumerating a visual class.
.TP
.B \-version
Display the current version
(a six digit string containing the date stamp of the source files).
.SH ENVIRONMENT
If any of the following environment variables exist,
they are used:
.TP
.B BROWSER
Specifies the name of a browser program for examining documentation.
.TP
.B AUTOTRACE
Specifies the location of the autotrace program (usually PfaEdit can figure
this out without help, but not always).
.TP
.B MF
Specifies the location of the metafont program.
.TP
.B PFAEDIT_VERBOSE
Turns on verbose mode in scripting. Each statement is printed as it is executed.
.SH FILES
