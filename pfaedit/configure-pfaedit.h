/* I doubt anyone but me will be interested in the tile path command, so I    */
/*  don't include code for it by default, but if you do want it simply define */

/* #define PFAEDIT_CONFIG_TILEPATH					      */
/*									      */
/* The tile path command uses the contents of the clipboard as a tile which is*/
/*  applied to any selected paths, replacing them. It could be used to make a */
/*  font whose stems were filled with celtic knotwork, for example */


/* I thought it would be fun to write a generalized non linear transformation */
/*  routine. I'm not sure that it's very useful though. It can be used to do  */
/*  perspective transformations and such				      */
/*									      */
/* #define PFAEDIT_CONFIG_NONLINEAR					      */
/*									      */
/* This command takes two strings which specify general expressions in x and y*/
/*  and applies the specified transformations to the splines.  Note: Each     */
/*  spline is transformed into a new spline, but some transformations require */
/*  that a spline be broken into components and each of those transformed eg: */
/*  "x' = x, y' = y+sin(x)" would not produce anything useful when applied to */
/*  a long line segment like [0,100]иии[100,100], but if that were broken up */
/*  into sub-segments each pi long the results would be much better */


/* There used to be a property _XFREE86_GLYPH_RANGES (in bdf/pcf) fonts which */
/*  gave a quick view about what glyphs were in a bdf font. From what I gather*/
/*  this property has been dropped because it was redundant.  If you would    */
/*  like pfaedit to generate it						      */
